John Ordronaux (doctor)

John Ordronaux (1830 - January 20, 1908) was an American Civil War army surgeon, a professor of medical jurisprudence, a pioneering mental health commissioner and a generous patron of university endowments. Between 1859 and 1901 Ordronaux published at least fifteen books and articles about subjects as diverse as heroes of the American Revolution of 1776, military medicine, medical jurisprudence, mental health, United States constitutional law and historical treatises. He left an estate worth $2,757,000 much of which he gave in endowments to several US universities and other institutions. He did not marry.
Early life.
Ordronaux was the only son of Captain John Ordronaux (a notable privateer of the War of 1812), and his wife Jean Marie Elizabeth Ordronaux (née Charretton). This is supported by the younger Ordronaux's will which mentions a bequest to his sister Florine, and to his nieces Clara and May Molan, matching genealogical information prepared by an Ordronaux family member.
He graduated from Dartmouth College in 1850, from Harvard Law School in 1852, and from the National Medical School in 1859. In 1859 he published his first book a "Eulogy on the life and character of Rev. Zachariah Greene", who, before taking Holy Orders, had fought under Washington in the revolution of 1776 at the age of seventeen. In 1860 Ordronaux became a Professor of medical jurisprudence at Columbia Law School, a post that he held until 1887. Since 1861 he had also been a lecturer at Dartmouth College, The University of Vermont and Boston University.
American Civil War.
During the American Civil War Ordronaux served as an army surgeon stationed in New York. He also acted as a military medical advisor and between 1861 and 1863 he published two textbooks on the health of armies, and an instruction manual of medical criteria for examining recruits. In the introduction to the latter, which was written for the United States Sanitary Commission, he said, "The preservation of health in armies, is everywhere a subject of recognized importance. So much, in fact, depends upon it, that precautionary measures in this behalf can never be exaggerated. All that can be done, should be done to protect troops against preventable disease. It seems to have been formerly believed, that the presence of a surgeon in each regiment was all sufficient for this purpose ; and that officers and men could go their way free from any responsibility or apprehension on that score. But experience has proved that the preservation of health, in either one man, or many, is not purely objective with surgeons. Too much, in this particular, is expected from them, and too little is done by officers to cooperate with them. Armies, like patients, must act in concert with their medical advisers, and make the matter of health subjective as well as objective. Officers and men need an insight into the general principles of hygiene, in order to be able to assist, themselves, in furthering prophylactic measures. To supply them with the requisite amount of information, the accompanying popular manual has therefore been prepared."
In 1863 he wrote a historical treatise in French (with Reinaud) on the commercial and political relations between the Roman Empire and the countries of Oriental Asia. In 1864 he wrote a second report for the United States Sanitary Commission. This concerned pensions for the war wounded and was subtitled, "On a system for the economical relief of disabled soldiers, and on certain proposed amendments to our present pension laws".
After the war.
After the war he returned to Columbia Law School and began writing again. Between 1867 and 1871 he produced a book on preventative medicine and two textbooks on medical jurisprudence. He also translated into English verse the medieval Latin text of Regimen sanitatis Salernitanum, the medical encyclopedia of the Scuola Medica Salernitana. This school in Salerno, Italy was the pre-eminent medical school in Europe in the 11th century. This was not the first English translation but an attempt to make a medically accurate one. He appears to have done this as a tribute to former members of his profession and in an introduction to his work he said, ""Regimen Sanitatis Salerni" was a work of transcendent merit. Though written in the early twilight of the Middle Ages and in inferior Latin, it at once took its place alongside of such classic productions as the Aphorisms of Hippocrates. No secular work, indeed, ever met with more popular favor, nor infused its canons so radically into the dogmas of any science. It was for ages the medical Bible of all Western Europe, and held undisputed sway over the teachings of its schools, next to the writings of Hippocrates and Galen".
Work on mental health.
Ordronaux developed an interest in mental health and between 1872 and 1882 he was a member of the New York State Commission in Lunacy writing two books on the subject. The second of these books mentions the opening of a ground breaking mental hospital and in his preface to the book he says, "The recent establishment of a department of Lunacy supervision by the State of New York, has turned public attention to it as a source for consultation, in the application of our Statute and Common Law to the legal relations of the insane...Insanity is a subject which touches our civil rights at so many different points, that it may be said to have a place in every problem involving human responsibility. It begins with man in the cradle, and follows him to the grave. It is often part of his physical heritage, and may become a qualifying element in all his civil acts. To collect and embody in one treatise the principles of law by which courts govern their adjudications in questions of mental incapacity, and to expound through commentaries both the philosophy of these decisions and the rules of procedure under which they are rendered, is the object aimed at in this manual of Lunacy practice".
Ordronaux's activity as a Commissioner was frequently mentioned in the press. In 1875 he was called in to adjudicate whether a man, who was under sentence of death for murder, was insane. The same newspaper reported again on 7 January 1876 how Ordronaux had found that Kings County Lunatic Asylum was being mismanaged by the charity commissioners (17). He also investigated complaints from two inmates in Buffalo asylum of abusive behaviour by their carers. In his report Ordronaux upheld the complaints and recommended the discharge of the two staff involved. By 1882 his forward thinking and outspokenness had made him some enemies and in 1882 his salary of $4000 as Commissioner in Lunacy was temporarily opposed in debate in the finance committee of the New York State Senate.
U.S. Constitution.
Ordronaux's work on State law in New York led him to consider its relationship with Federal law, and in 1891 he published what may be his most important book, on the relationship between the powers of Congress and State legislatures. About this book of more than 600 pages, Ordonaux said in the preface, "The accompanying work is an attempt to present in a concrete form the entire system of Federal and State legislation, as practised under a written Constitution in the United States. Its object is to expound those administrative powers which, in our dual form of representative government, are sovereign within their several spheres of action...A written Constitution is a political grammar to whose rules administrative laws must conform, in order to give them judicial validity...The government of forty four independent States, dwelling in harmonious relations under a supervisory Federal sovereignty, would seem, therefore, to justify the treatment of Legislation as a
department of jurisprudence meriting more textual consideration than it has yet received...the present treatise has been prepared to meet the wants of those who, desiring to practise or interpret the canons of representative government in the United States, may seek to master the secrets of its architecture through a study of the labors of its founders, and to trace its genesis and development to a providential origin in the Spartan Commonwealths of our colonial period."
Later life.
In 1898 Ordronaux wrote a biography of a Leonice Sampson Moulton, a presumed relative of his foster father, possibly his foster mother. She was born in 1811 and descended from the original Mayflower settlers to America. As Miss Sampson, she was sent on a secret mission to the US embassy in Buenos Aires to enquire into the sovereignty dispute between Great Britain and Argentina over the Falkland Islands. She is interesting according to Ordronaux for, among other things, keeping a very detailed diary which was far more comprehensive than the logs of the ships upon which she travelled.
On 27 June 1901 Ordronaux addressed the graduate students of The University of Vermont. Reading like a tribute to his own life's work he says, "A strange feeling possesses me as I rise to address you...I am here to perform, with much surprise to myself, the same duty which devolved upon me, on a similar occasion, thirty six years ago...I stand in the presence of two distinct periods with all their differing and startling results. In this long interval, too long to be measured by the standard of months, and falling more properly in the category of cycles, the drama of human society has moved with accelerated pace. A generation has acted its part of good and evil, then passed to its final account. Science, the industrial art, Education, Commerce, Navigation, have all spread their wings as never before. Our country has added nine states to the framework of our Federal Union, and buttressed its Constitution with armor plated Amendments whose necessity had never been contemplated. Our very name, the United States, has changed its former significance and been adjudicated by our highest Appellate Tribunal to be no longer a plural substantive, but a noun in the singular number describing a nation of political equals, and not a league or partnership of States."
Ordronaux died of "apoplexy" at his home, Glen Head, in Roslyn, New York on 20 January 1908. His estate was initially valued at nearly $1,000,000. A large part of his bequests were to hospitals, universities, churches and other public institutions. These included $30,000 to Dartmouth College and $10,000 each to Trinity College, Hartford, Connecticut, The University of Vermont and the Episcopal Diocese of Long Island. However, the New York Times reported on 8 August 1908 that Ordronaux's total estate amounted to $2,757,000, the bulk of which was left to his three surviving sisters.

The organization’s mission is to help children and adults who are blind, visually impaired or multi-disabled achieve independence. Located in Los Angeles, Junior Blind offers individualized methods of early intervention, education, recreation and rehabilitation to nearly 10,000 children and family members throughout California.
President and CEO, Miki Jordan, joined the organization in 2006 as the third CEO in the organization’s more than 55 year history. In January 2010, long-time supporter Stevie Wonder joined Junior Blind’s Board of Directors after many years of generous donations and special appearances at Junior Blind’s annual Children’s Holiday Carnival.
Programs and services.
Although Junior Blind’s programs serve individuals across all stages of life, more than 98% of the people the organization serves are children and youth. Since the "face" of blindness has changed, a large number of the children Junior Blind serves have multiple disabilities, including autism, cerebral palsy, developmental delay and mental retardation, in addition to visual impairment.
Junior Blind’s children’s services are provided in the home, on-campus and throughout the community. Meeting the varying needs of children with special needs from birth to age 21, Junior Blind offers an Infant & Early Childhood Program, a Special Education School, a Children’s Residential Program, a Vision Screening Program and an After School Enrichment Program.
The organization is also committed to helping youth, adults and Veterans who are blind or visually impaired prepare for a life of independence and success. Providing educational, vocational and independent living instruction through the Student Transition & Enrichment Program and its mobile counterpart, Davidson Program for Independence, Blind Veterans Training Program and Advanced Assistive Technology Training, Junior Blind helps students learn the skills necessary to live independently, seek employment and be productive members of the community.
With a firm belief that recreation is crucial to a child’s healthy development, growth and independence, Junior Blind offers educational and experiential learning through the Visions: Adventures in Learning Program and their Camp Bloomfield in Malibu. Weekend Visions trips to national treasures such as Yosemite, as well as summer camp sessions at Camp Bloomfield, provide children who are blind, visually impaired or multi-disabled with the chance to build confidence, develop habits toward healthier lifestyles and gain independence.
Junior Blind Olympics.
Each year, Junior Blind hosts a number of events for children and families. The organization’s signature event, Junior Blind Olympics, invites boys and girls ages 6 to 19 to compete in Olympic-style events adapted for the blind. Athletes come from California, Utah, Arizona, Nevada and elsewhere to compete in such events as rowing, shot put, 100-yard dash, archery, rock wall climbing and the long jump, among others.
Support.
Junior Blind relies on private donations for more than half of its operating budget. 
Junior Blind meets all 20 of the BBB Wise Giving Alliance’s Standards for Charity Accountability.

Krallice

Krallice is a black metal band formed by New York City musicians Colin Marston, Mick Barr, Nick McMaster and Lev Weinstein.
History.
Krallice was first mentioned by Marston in February 2008 as a collaboration between himself and Mick Barr. Marston, a member of the instrumental metal groups Behold... The Arctopus and Dysrhythmia, and Barr, a member of tech metal duo Orthrelm, performed together on a split in 2006, and continued a working relationship from which Krallice developed. Lev Weinstein had joined sometime after and the trio recorded and released their eponymous debut album on Canadian independent record label Profound Lore in 2008 to high critical praise.
Nick McMaster was brought in to perform live bass. McMaster had been featured as an additional vocalist on the debut album, but joined the band full time shortly after its release (the bass on the first album was performed by both Marston and Barr). McMaster also created some of the artwork for their second album "Dimensional Bleedthrough", which was released in November 2009 again on Profound Lore.
Musical style.
Krallice plays a form of progressive black metal somewhat similar in style to that of Weakling and Wolves in the Throne Room. The band's music features dense multi-tracked guitars often performing tremolo picked lines described as fast and precise. It is also described as a throwback to the early days of Burzum, Gorgoroth, and Ulver.
Marston records the band in his own studio "Menegroth: The Thousand Caves". Initially the band intended to use a lo-fi approach similar to much earlier black metal, however, the dense sonorities proved too difficult to control. The result was a more "pure and ambient" sound as opposed to the buzzy quality found on older black metal.

Ramadan Revolution

The Ramadan Revolution, also referred to as the 8 February Revolution and the February 1963 Coup d'état in Iraq, was a military coup by the Ba'ath Party's Iraqi-wing which overthrew the Prime Minister of Iraq, Abd al-Karim Qasim in 1963. General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr became the new Prime Minister and Colonel Abdul Salam Arif became President. Revolutionary leaders and supporters of the coup referred to it as a movement, rather than a coup.
History.
Background.
Some time after the Homeland Officers' Organization, or "Al-Ahrar" ("The Free") succeeded in toppling the monarchy and transforming the Iraqi regime into a republic in 1958, signs of differences between political parties and forces and the Homeland Officers' Organization began when Pan-Arab nationalist forces led by Abdul Salam Arif and the Ba'ath Party called for immediate unification with the United Arab Republic (UAR). In an attempt to create a state of political equilibrium, the Iraqi Communist Party, which opposed unity, tried to discount cooperation with the UAR in economics, culture, and science rather than political and military agreements.
Gradually Abd al-Karim Qasim's relations with some of his fellow members of Al-Ahrar worsened, and his relationship with the unionist and nationalist currents, which had played an active role in supporting the 1958 movement, became strained. As for conflicting currents in the Iraqi Communist Party, they were aspiring for a coalition with General Qasim, and had long been extending their relationship with him, since Qasim thought that some of his allies in the Communist party were coming close to leapfrogging the proposition, especially after the increasing influence of the Communist party in the use of the slogan, proclaimed by many Communists and government supporters during marches: "Long live leader Abd al-Karim and the Communist Party in governing great demand!" This made him from that time begin to minimize the Communist movement, which was poised to overthrow the regime. He ordered the party to be disarmed and most of the party leaders to be arrested. However, the party retained Air Commander Celalettin Alaoqati and Lt. Col. Fadhil Abbas Mahdawi, Qasim's cousin.
An overlapping set of both internal and regional factors created conditions conducive to the overthrow of Prime Minister Abd al-Karim Qasim and his staff. Some believe that it can be attributed to the blundering individualism of Qasim and the errors committed in the execution of leaders and locals as well as acts of violence which arose from the Communist militias allied with Qasim. Also to blame may be an increasingly forceful disagreement with Field Marshal Abdul Salam Aref, who was under house arrest. All of this as well as statements Qasim made reiterating his support for Syrian General Abdel-Karim and Colonel Alnhlaoi Mowaffaq Asasa, with a view to executing a coup to divide Syria, which was alone with Egypt as part of the United Arab Republic. This was because of the game of international politics and its role in the promotion of or endorsement of Qasim's political opposition.
Qasim was aspiring to reach out in a friendly way to the Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact to try socialism and develop a strategic defense treaty.
Coup.
Qasim's removal took place on 8 February 1963, the fourteenth day of Ramadan and therefore called the 14 Ramadan Coup. The coup had been in its planning stages since 1962, and several attempts had been planned, only to be abandoned for fear of discovery. The coup had been initially planned for January 18, but was moved to 25 January, then 8 February after Qasim gained knowledge of the proposed attempt and arrested some of the plotters.
The coup began in the early morning of 8 February 1963, when the communist air force chief, Jalal al-Awqati was assassinated and tank units occupied the Abu Ghrayb radio station. A bitter two day struggle unfolded with heavy fighting between the Ba’athist conspirators and pro-Qasim forces. Qasim took refuge in the Ministry of Defence, where fighting became particularly heavy. Communist sympathisers took to the streets to resist the coup adding to the high casualties.
On 9 February Qasim eventually offered his surrender in return for safe passage out of the country. His request was refused, and on the afternoon of the 9th, Qasim was executed on the orders of the newly formed National Council of the Revolutionary Command (NCRC).
Qasim was given a mock trial over Baghdad radio and then killed. His dead body was displayed on television by leaders of the coup soon after his death.
At least 5,000 Iraqis were killed in the fighting from 8–10 February 1963, and in the house-to-house hunt for "communists" that immediately followed. Ba'athists put the losses of their own party at around 80.
Aftermath.
The Ba'athist regime was overthrown on 10 November 1963, following internal struggle within the party.
U.S. knowledge of coup.
Writing in his memoirs of the 1963 coup, long time OSS and CIA intelligence analyst Harry Rositzke presented it as an example of one on which they had good intelligence in contrast to others that caught the agency by surprise. The overthrow "was forecast in exact detail by CIA agents." "Agents in the Ba’th Party headquarters in Baghdad had for years kept Washington au courant on the party’s personnel and organization, its secret communications and sources of funds, and its penetrations of military and civilian hierarchies in several countries...CIA sources were in a perfect position to follow each step of Ba’th preparations for the Iraqi coup, which focused on making contacts with military and civilian leaders in Baghdad. The CIA’s major source, in an ideal catbird seat, reported the exact time of the coup and provided a list of the new cabinet members...To call an upcoming coup requires the CIA to have sources within the group of plotters. Yet, from a diplomatic point of view, having secret contacts with plotters implies at least unofficial complicity in the plot."
Qasim was aware of U.S. complicity in the plot and continually denounced the U.S. in public. The Department of State was worried that Qasim would harass American diplomats in Iraq because of this.
The best direct evidence that the U.S. was complicit is the memo from NSC staff member Bob Komer to President John F. Kennedy on the night of the coup, February 8, 1963. The last paragraph reads:
"We will make informal friendly noises as soon as we can find out whom to talk with, and ought to recognize as soon as we’re sure these guys are firmly in the saddle. CIA had excellent reports on the plotting, but I doubt either they or UK should claim much credit for it.
Documents show that the CIA was well aware of many plots within Iraq throughout 1962, not just the Ba'athist one.
The new government used lists, allegedly provided by the CIA, to systematically murder unknown numbers of suspected communists. The victims included hundreds of doctors, teachers, technicians, lawyers and other professionals as well as military and political figures.
According to former CIA Near East Division Chief James Chritchfield, the CIA took interest in the Ba'ath Party around 1961-2, and "was better informed on the 1963 coup in Baghdad than on any other major event or change of government that took place in the whole region in those years;" however, it did not "actively support" the coup. "Several months later," the Ba'ath "staged a kind of counter-coup," which led Arif to purge the party in the November 1963 Iraqi coup d'état. The CIA "did not identify a radical movement within the Ba'ath," and was "surprised" by the power struggles that followed the Ramadan Revolution. After al-Bakr and Vice President Saddam Hussein seized power in 1968, "America slowly developed, not a hostility, but enormous reservations about the ability of the Ba'ath to constructively bring Iraq along." 
Influence on Syria.
That same year, the Syrian party’s military committee succeeded in persuading Nasserist and independent officers to make common cause with it, and successfully carried out a military coup on 8 March. A National Revolutionary Command Council took control and assigned itself legislative power; it appointed Salah al-Din al-Bitar as head of a "national front" government. The Ba'th participated in this government along with the Arab Nationalist Movement, the United Arab Front and the Socialist Unity Movement.
As historian Hanna Batatu notes, this took place without the fundamental disagreement over immediate or "considered" reunification having been resolved. The Ba'ath moved to consolidate its power within the new regime, purging Nasserist officers in April. Subsequent disturbances led to the fall of the al-Bitar government, and in the aftermath of Jasim Alwan’s failed Nasserist coup in July, the Ba'th monopolized power.

Multipart Solutions

Multipart Solutions Limited is a firm that supplies spare parts and components to customers in the automotive, defence and utility sectors in the United Kingdom and Europe.
The company is split into two divisions: Multipart Supply Chain Solutions and Multipart Defence.
Multipart's major customers include; LDV, Isuzu, TVR, Modec and Dennis Eagle in the automotive sector; BAE Systems, MBDA and the Ministry of Defence in the defence sector; and Anglian Water.
History.
Multipart can find its origins in the Leyland Motors company. In 1914 the company opened a new works on Pilling Lane in Chorley to manufacture Fire Appliances. In 1919 the company formed the First Parts Stores at Chorley; the beginnings of Multipart. 
In 1980 the British Leyland subsidiary Leyland Vehicles launched the Multipart brand as the as All Makes Truck, Van & Bus parts range. In 1993 after the collapse of Leyland DAF the Multipart division, along with the Chorley site, was acquired in a management buy-in. Two years later the firm was bought by LEX and renamed LEX Multipart. After this, Multipart expanded and began to focus on the military and automotive sectors as well as opening sites at Crick and at Bicester alongside the Ministry of Defence.
In 2001 the company was taken over by the RAC which was itself taken over by Aviva in 2006.
The company made it most historic move in 2007 when it moved from the Pilling Lane Works after 93 years to a new custom built site at Buckshaw Village.
In 2008 the company was once again bought in a management buy-in.

We Don't Wanna Put In

"We Don't Wanna Put In" is a 2009 song by Stephane & 3G and was to have been the Georgian entry to the Eurovision Song Contest 2009 held in Moscow, composed by Stefane Mgebrishvili and written by Bibi Kvachadze.
The song caused controversy as it is seen to contain political references to Prime Minister of Russia Vladimir Putin in the lyrics. "Put in" sounded alike with Putin. 
The words "put in" are sung with accented pronunciation as "poot een", which is how the Russian prime minister's name is pronounced.
In the face of the pressure to make alterations to the lyrics from some of Russia's and Georgia's cultural and political figures (including Diana Gurtskaya, 2008 competitor from Georgia, and David Gamkrelidze, leader of the New Rights Party of Georgia), the official Georgian Eurovision spokesman said on 20 February 2009 that the song would not be amended. 
On 10 March 2009, the European Broadcasting Union ruled that the song lyrics "do not comply with Section 4 Rule 9 of the Rules of the 54th Eurovision Song Contest, and cannot take part in the competition as such", which meant that Georgia would have had to rewrite the song or choose another entry. A spokesman for the EBU said, "No lyrics, speeches, gestures of a political or similar nature shall be permitted."
Withdrawal of Georgia.
On 11 March 2009, Georgia withdrew from the Eurovision Song Contest 2009, refusing to change the song lyrics and alleging that the decision to ask Georgia to revise its entry came about as a result of pressure from Russia, although no evidence of pressure being applied has been provided.

North Glasgow College

North Glasgow College was a college located at Springburn in Glasgow and was one of the main providers of further education in the city. Due to financial difficulties experienced by the North British Locomotive Company in 1961, the main administration building of the company on Flemington Street was sold to Glasgow Corporation for use as an annexe of Stow College, until becoming Springburn College of Engineering in 1965 and later Springburn College in 1981. Its primary role was the teaching of engineering apprentices. The college merged with Barmulloch College in 1990, being renamed North Glasgow College. The new combined college remained located in the former headquarters of the North British Locomotive Company but in early 2009 moved to a new purpose built campus opposite, on the site of the former NBL Hyde Park railway works. The new college building won an Royal Institute of British Architects Award for its design in 2009.
The college merged with Stow College and John Wheatley College on 1 November 2013 to form Glasgow Kelvin College.

SBMV Protocol

SBMV Protocol is an advanced encrypted telemetry that uses short-burst, multi-version technology.
Telemetry.
Telemetry technology enables “the remote measurement and reporting of information”.
Telemetry is also a “highly automated communications process by which measurements are made and other data collected at remote or inaccessible points and transmitted to receiving equipment for monitoring, display, and recording.”
Methodology.
SBMV technology is based on Quantum Cryptography, "an emerging technology in which two parties may simultaneously generate shared, secret cryptographic key material using the transmission of quantum states of light. The security of these transmissions is based on the inviolability of the laws of quantum mechanics and information-theoretically secure post-processing methods."
SBMV Protocol encrypts data by quickly breaking text, numerical, and/or image data into tens of thousands of small packets that are then copied into hundreds of thousands of slightly altered versions. This technology renders interception useless because it becomes statistically impossible for the intercepting party to have enough time and computing resources to select which version is the true and correct version among millions of versions of the data.
Origins.
SBMV Protocol was first created in 1971 for spacecraft, missile, RPV, oil rig, and chemical plant telemetry and telecommand links by mathematicians David Yeeda and Andrei Krolovich, who formed The Aeorads Company for commercial and military aerospace applications of SBMV technology. New Methods, op cit.
Uses.
SBMV technology was further developed with Internet Protocol applications at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (United States Air Force Research Laboratory) in Ohio, where defense contractor Aeorads Company refined the technology for web-based uses in aircraft, spacecraft, and missiles. A non-classified civilian version of SBMV technology was also created for chemical plants and remote oil rigs and alternative energy wind farms (primarily for offshore and very remote facilities).

<doc id="21596289" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21596289" title="Sorin Group">
Sorin Group

The Sorin Group is a medical products group based in Italy, with significant operations in France, the United States, and Japan, specializing in cardiac devices. Its product lines include replacement heart valves, oxygenators, perfusion tubing sets, cardiothoracic surgery accessories, data monitoring, heart-lung machines, autotransfusion systems, and cannulae, and a line of blood management products. 
It began as a nuclear research company owned primarily by Fiat, transformed into a biomedical company upon nationalization of Italy's electric system, sold to SNIA S.p.A., and finally spun off as a separate company listed on the Milan Stock Exchange. Along the way, it and its earlier parent companies bought and sold various other companies, including Dideco, Stöckert, and ELA Medical.
History.
Sorin is an acronym for Società Ricerche Impianti Nucleari (Company for Nuclear Plant Research). It was founded in 1956 by Fiat and Montedison, Italy's two largest industrial groups at that time, to tackle the problems inherent in the production of nuclear energy. Sorin was created as a research company and was equipped with an experimental reactor for materials research. It was intended to serve as the "brain" that would mastermind the nuclear energy projects that the two groups were planning. At the time, Sorin did not have ambitions in the medical field. However, in the decade following its founding, it accumulated significant technological knowhow in all of the major areas of science. This was because nuclear energy requires expertise in many areas, from electronics to chemistry, materials technology and even experimental physics. After 10 years in business, Sorin had become a repository of knowledge and skills that were important for the country as a whole.
When the nuclear power industry was hit by a crisis caused by the nationalization of the electric utilities, the Company switched businesses, focusing on technologies related to medicine, and changed its name to Sorin Biomedica (Fiat Group). The conversion was successful: in just three years, Sorin Biomedica became a self-sustaining, profitable company. This success greatly enhanced the Company's image both in Italy and Europe, as Sorin was the only European nuclear research company that was able to transform itself into an industrial company with vast technological knowhow. Over the years, Sorin continued to expand, acquiring competitors in Italy and abroad - in France and the United States in particular.
In 1985, Sorin Biomedica listed its shares on the Milan Stock Exchange. In 1986 it was taken over by Snia, when Fiat conveyed a 75% interest in Sorin Biomedica to Snia.
In 1992, Sorin Biomedica purchased Shiley, the Cardiovascular Devices Division of a group headed by Pfizer Inc., a U.S. company. The acquisition included (i) Dideco, an Italian company that was the European leader in the market for extracorporeal blood circulation and autologous blood transfusion products, and (ii) Stöckert, a leading world producer and distributor of heart-lung machines, as well as their subsidiaries. With these acquisitions, Sorin Biomedica established itself as an international player with a leadership position in Europe and a global distribution network, with an especially effective presence in the highly profitable Japanese market. Penetration of the U.S. market - the world's largest - remained limited.
In 1996, the Group launched an internal project to develop a coronary angioplasty product line (catheters and stents). In this rapidly growing business, Sorin Biomedica was able to benefit from technological cross fertilization and to leverage its twenty years of experience in developing artificial cardiac valves, particularly those using CarboFilm technology. In 1999, Sorin Biomedica began marketing its Sorin CarboStent, which gained a significant market share in just a few years thanks to its outstanding clinical characteristics.
In 1997, the Group divested its Immunodiagnostics operations, since their development would have required massive investments in R&D to keep pace with technological evolution. Moreover, they offered no synergies with the Group's Cardiovascular Medical Devices operations, which had become its core business following the acquisition of Shiley.
In May 1999, Snia bought Cobe Cardiovascular, a company based in Denver, Colorado, that was its main competitor in the cardiac surgery market. This acquisition propelled Sorin Biomedica to the top of the world cardiovascular market and made it the U.S. leader in the industry. The old Shiley operations were transferred to Denver, and the Cobe/Dideco/Sorin sales organizations were quickly streamlined.
In 2000, Sorin Biomedica was merged into and absorbed by Snia, and its shares were withdrawn from listing. In May 2001, the Snia Group purchased Ela Medical from Sanofi - Synthélabo. The acquisition of Ela Medical, a company with production facilities in Paris, France, strengthened the Group's position in the cardiac rhythm management market (pacemakers and implantable defibrillators). Ela Medical's assets included a vast portfolio of patents, a direct sales presence in the U.S. market and a line of FDA-approved products, as well as a respectable share of the European market.
In April 2002, the Snia Group acquired from Dialinvest S.A. control of Soludia, a French company specializing in the manufacture of dialysis solutions, thereby strengthening the product portfolio and European presence of the Renal Care Business Unit. In January 2003, the Snia Group bought from Centerpulse the CarboMedics Group, a U.S. producer of mechanical heart valves based in Austin, Texas, and Mitroflow, a Canadian based producer of tissue valves. This acquisition significantly strengthened the position of the Sorin Group in the cardiovascular industry and increased its penetration of the U.S. market. In addition, the acquisition made Sorin the world co-leader in mechanical heart valves and significantly expanded its tissue valve business.
In January 2004, following Snia's partial proportional demerger, the Sorin Group, which is headed by the holding company Sorin S.p.A., had been listed independently on the Online Stock Market of Borsa Italiana.
A reversal of a decade of downsizing at the Denver (Arvada), USA location is due to recent transfer of Sorin's Plymouth, MN operations into part of the vacated site in Denver.

Krallice is the eponymous debut album by the New York–based black metal band Krallice. It was released on compact disc in 2008 on Canadian-based Profound Lore Records, and on vinyl in 2009 by American-based Gilead Media.
The album was recorded before Nick McMaster had joined the band, therefore, he only appears as an additional vocalist on the recording and the bass was performed by both Marston and Barr.
Recording.
Colin Marston recorded, mixed and mastered the album in his studio Menegroth, the Thousand Caves in Woodhaven, Queens. Though the band initially intended to use a lo-fi approach, the music was too dense to come out successfully. The album was recorded on 2" tape with multiple microphones and guitar layers. Marston describes it as "pure and ambient" as a contrast to the buzzy trebley guitar and fake reverb found on some older black metal. The guitars were doubled with different tones and recorded in the same room as the amps so that feedback proliferates the recording. The bass was run through two amplifiers, one slightly dirtier than the other. The drums were tuned as low as possible and recorded from a distance to give a loud sound with no reverb or triggers.

Spynie Canal was created as the culmination of attempts to drain Loch Spynie (which survives as a small loch) and the low lying areas between Spynie Palace and Lossiemouth, the surplus water flowing through sluice gates at Lossiemouth. Thomas Telford was consulted in 1808 and the contractor for the work 1808-11 was a Mr Hughes, who had worked on the Caledonian Canal. The unprecedented floods of 1829 caused considerable damage and subsequently dykes were thrown up along the canal's banks.

Matty Fouhy

Matty Fouhy was an Irish sportsperson. He played hurling with his local club Carrigtwohill and was a member of the Cork senior inter-county team from 1950 until 1954.
Playing career.
Club.
Fouhy played his club hurling with his local club in Carrigtwohill and enjoyed some success. His major moments of victory came in 1949 and 1950 when Carrigtwohill captured back-to-back county intermediate championship titles.
Inter-county.
Fouhy first came to prominence with the Cork senior hurling team in 1950. That year he made his debut in the Munster championship, however, Cork made an early exit after a defeat by Tipperary in the provincial decider.
After a period in the hurling wilderness the Cork team bounced back in 1952, however, Fouhy was still a substitute as Cork defeated of three-in-a-row All-Ireland champions Tipperary in the provincial decider. Dublin provided the opposition in the subsequent All-Ireland final with Fouhy returning for that game. ‘The Dubs’ were completely outclassed by Cork on that occasion. In spite of only leading by three points at half-time Cork won easily by 2-14 to 0-7 and Fouhy picked up a coveted All-Ireland winners' medal. 
1953 began well for Cork with Fouhy collecting a National Hurling League title after a defeat of Tipperary. The success continued later on that summer as Fouhy added a first Munster title to his collection after Tipperary were accounted for in the provincial final. The subsequent All-Ireland final saw Galway take on Cork, however, 'the Rebels' were victorious by 3-3 to 0-8 and Fouhy added a second All-Ireland medal to his collection. The game has gone down in history as one of the dirtiest All-Ireland deciders ever. 
In 1954 Fouhy was still a key member of the team as Cork set out on their three-in-a-row trail. Tipperary fell to Cork by 2-8 to 1-8 in the provincial final, giving the ‘Carrig’ man a second Munster winners' medal. A third All-Ireland final appearance beckoned for the Cork man, with Wexford providing the opposition. A record attendance of nearly 85,000 people packed into Croke Park to witness the Munster champions defeating the Leinster champions by 1-9 to 1-6. While Christy Ring captured a record-breaking eighth All-Ireland medal, Fouhy picked up a third consecutive winners' memento. He retired from inter-county hurling shortly afterwards.
Inter-provincial.
Fouhy also lined out with Munster in the inter-provincial hurling competition and enjoyed much success. He first lined out with his province in 1950. That year he picked up his first Railway Cup winners' medal as Munster triumphed over Leinster. It was the first of four Railway Cup titles in-a-row for Fouhy and for Munster. Munster were defeated by Leinster in 1954 as Fouhy hoped to make it five-in-a-row.

SS Empire Bunting

SS "Empire Bunting" was a 6,318 ton cargo ship which was built in 1919. She saw service in the interwar period under the American flag, but was transferred to the British Ministry of War Transport during the Second World War. She made a number of cross-Atlantic voyages, often sailing in convoys. She ended her career by being sunk as a blockship on the Normandy coast, supporting the allied landings there in 1944.
Description.
"Empire Bunting" was built as "Eelbeck" by the shipbuilding firm of Skinner & Eddy Corporation, Seattle, Washington, and launched on 28 June 1919 and completed in August 1919 for service with United States Shipping Board (USSB). She was long, with a beam of and a depth of . She was propelled by a triple expansion steam engine which had cylinders of , and bore by stroke. The engine was built by Hooven, Owens & Rentschler, Hamilton, Ohio. The ship had a speed of .
Career.
"Eelbeck"'s port of registry was Seattle. She sailed for the USSB until the board's abolition, and by 1937 was sailing for its successor organisation, the United States Maritime Commission. "Eelbeck" continued to sail under the American flag after the outbreak of the Second World War, during the period of American neutrality. In 1941, with the American entry to the war, "Eelbeck" was transferred to the ownership of the Ministry of War Transport, which assigned her to be operated by the firm of Headlam & Sons, under the name of "Empire Bunting". Her port of registry was changed to London.
"Empire Bunting" went on to sail in a considerable number of convoys across the North Atlantic, often carrying scrap steel or general cargo to Britain from Canada or the United States.
Convoy SC 38 depatred Sydney, Nova Scotia on 22 July 1941 and arrived at Liverpool on 8 August. "Empire Bunting" was carrying a cargo of scrap steel. She was forced to return to St John's aftee she collided with the Greek merchant ship "Dimitrios Chandris".
Convoy SC 121 departed New York on 23 February 1943 and arrived at Liverpool on 14 March. "Empire Bunting" was one of three ships which joined the convoy from St. John's, Newfoundland. She was carrying a general cargo bound for the Clyde. On 11 March, her steering failed and she arrived at Liverpool under tow.
Convoy HX 254 departed New York on 27 August 1943 and arrived at Liverpool on 12 September. "Empire Bunting" was carrying a general cargo bound for Glasgow. She put into St John's with an engine defect which was causing her to produce heavy smoke and run at reduced speed.
In early 1944 she was reassigned to be operated by J & J. Denholm Ltd, but in February she was purchased by the Admiralty. She made her last wartime voyage as part of one of the Corn cob convoys, sailing from Poole to the Seine Bay in early June 1944. She was scuttled at Juno Beach on 9 June 1944, forming one of the corn cobs designed to shelter the landing beaches for the invasion forces.
"Empire Bunting" was salvaged in 1947, towed to Strangford Lough and broken up there.
Official Numbers and Code Letters.
Official Numbers were a forerunner to IMO Numbers. "Eelbeck" had the United States Official Number 218667. "Empire Bunting" had the UK Official Number 168163.
"Eelbeck" used the Code Letters LSGC until 1934, when they were changed to KINQ. "Empire Bunting " used the Code Letters GMKM.

Hans Andersen Foss

Hans Andersen Foss (November 25, 1851 - July 9, 1929) was an American author, newspaper editor and temperance leader. Born the son of a small tenant farmer in 1851 in Modum, Buskerud county, Norway, Foss immigrated to the United States in 1887.
Biography.
A lifelong proponent of the temperance movement and the Populist Party, Foss edited several temperance publications and from 1888 to 1893 served as editor for the Norwegian language newspaper "Normanden" in Grand Forks, North Dakota. Foss gave up the newspaper business and became a grain dealer, eventually settling in Minot, North Dakota during 1906.
Foss wrote a number of novels, many first serialized in Norwegian language newspaper. Foss's writing style made him a popular author among Norwegian-American immigrants. However, Foss's lasting literary contribution is principally his influence on later, more widely known writers such as Peer Stromme and Ole Rølvaag.
Foss is most associated with his 1899 novel, "Husmands-gutte", (English: "The Cotter's Son").
The book, which tells the story of Ole Haugen, the son of the poor farmer in Sigdal, Norway, is considered by many to be a most accurate depiction of the lifestyle of farm workers in Norway. The popularity of "The Cotter's Son" serial was credited with saving the Decorah Posten from bankruptcy. "The Cotter's Son" has long enjoyed popularity in Norway, where numerous editions have been published.

Music for the People (The Enemy album)

Music for the People is the second studio album by Coventry-based indie rock band The Enemy, which was released 27 April 2009. It entered the UK charts at number two, losing out on the number one spot to Bob Dylan's "Together Through Life".
Background and recording.
Following a short break, the trio spent the majority of autumn 2008 recording in rural Wales at Monnow Valley Studio in South Wales with producer Jim Anderson and Mike Crossey. Whilst the plan was to capitalise on the buzz from their debut, the band didn't rush the sessions.
"We totally took our time," Clarke stated.
In early 2009, The Enemy completed the recording of the album. On their official MySpace blog, the band described the album as a "big step forward", deciding to "go back to basics with the recording and do it all on tape rather than computers which is how the vast majority of modern records are made, and as a result it sounds huge, like a proper old school rock record". They also described the album as having a more "raw and punkier sound", whilst Clarke noted that, although he was aiming to address various issues with the album's lyrics, the band took a less organised approach in writing them;
The lead single, "No Time For Tears", was debuted on BBC Radio 1 on 17 February 2009, including an interview with the band discussing tour dates and their "new sound". The single was officially released on 13 April, with the album following a fortnight later on 27 April. As part of the promotion for the album, the band played a number of gigs in small, intimate venues throughout February 2009, in Lincoln, York, Dundee, Wakefield, Tunbridge Wells and Corby.
The video for the second single, "Sing When You're In Love", was debuted on "T4" on 9 May 2009, and will be released on 22 June.
The third single, "Be Somebody", was used as theme music for the video game FIFA 10 and in ITV's FA Cup football coverage.
Critical reception.
The album received average to negative reviews scoring 4.5/10 at aggregator website AnyDecentMusic?, and 55/100 at Metacritic. NME gave the album 5 out of 10 stars in its review, stating that "Tom Clarke's lot aim for the stars but sadly fall painfully short." John Earls of Planet Sound saw the LP as a progression from the band's debut album, but found fault with the lyrical content. The album was severely criticized by There Goes The Fear who said " ‘Music For The People’ is 43 minutes of bland noise which sounds like the worst 80s punk bootleg you ever heard. Honestly, the band sound like your dad and uncle just set up a (bad) Clash tribute band." The album was pilloried for its broad use of plagiarism. Commenting on the opening track "Elephant Song", Drowned In Sound noticed its similarity to Led Zeppelin's "Kashmir". "Last Goodbye" and its use of strings was compared to The Verve. "Nation of Checkout Girls" has also been widely derided for sounding identical to "Common People" by Pulp, while another song on their album "Don't Break The Red Tape" has also been criticized for sounding similar to "London Calling" by The Clash. The BBC described the album as "terrible", asking, "What did the people ever do to deserve this?" Drowned In Sound concluded: "Never has reaching the end of a record been met with such a massive sigh of relief."

Hugh McClelland (cartoonist)

Hugh McClelland was a cartoonist who headed the cartoon department of the "Daily Mirror" in the UK.
In 1937, he introduced his wild Western comic strip "Beelzebub Jones" in the pages of the "Daily Mirror". After taking over as cartoon chief at the "Mirror" in 1945, he dropped "Beelzebub Jones" and moved on to a variety of new strips, including "Dan Doofer", "Sunshine Falls" and "Jimpy".
Drawing for "Sketch".
In 1952, he exited the "Mirror" for the tabloid "Daily Sketch". He drew "Pip Squeak and Wilfred" until 1956 when he left Selsey and emigrated with his family to Canada. He launched his last strip, "Jimmy Gimmicks", in 1957, but it lasted only two months.
McClelland had a working method that expedited his production. He would pencil 20 weeks of strips at one session, writing dialogue as he progressed and then ink these in outline. Lastly, he would go back and fill in the blacks.

Lac de Pareloup

Lac de Pareloup is a lake in Aveyron, France. It lies on the Lévézou plateau, 25 km south east of Rodez.
Description.
At an elevation of 805 m, its surface area is 12.6 km².
The impermeable granite rocks are very suitable for water capture though the undulating landscape alone does not allow the vertical drops needed for power generation. However, in 1950 the barrage was built and a goit dug leading to the Lac de Villefranche-de-Panat where the waters drop 461m vertically to the power station at Le Pouget on the Tarn river.
This is the fifth largest hydroelectric reservoir by area in France having an area of 1260 hectares. It was formed by creating a dam across the Vioulou, and pumping water 6.4 km, up 80 m from the 53-hectare Bage reservoir on the Bage river and water from the 200 ha Pont-de-Salars reservoir on the Viaur.
Waters from Pareloup can be directed either through the downstream Viaur to the power station at Thuries or through a 10.9 km tunnel to the power station at Alrance at the head of the Lac de Villefranche-de-Panat. A small amount (3.5 hm3) is extracted for use as drinking water in Rodez and Ségala. Pareloup has a catchment area of 376 km2: 160 km2 from the Vioulou, Gourde and Céor, 216 km2 from the Viaur and Bage. The dam at Pareloup is 43.45 m high and 232 m long- it is 15.87 metres thick at its base, tapering to 2.77 m at the rim. It holds back 167 million  m3 of usable water.

Wendell Erickson

Wendell O. Erickson (born June 17, 1925 in Isanti County, Minnesota) was a Minnesota politician and is a former member of the Minnesota House of Representatives from southwestern Minnesota.
Service in the Minnesota House.
First elected in 1964, Erickson was re-elected every two years until 1986. A Republican, he represented the old Districts 19B and 26B and, later, 27B, which included all or portions of Lincoln, Lyon, Murray, Nobles, Pipestone and Rock counties, changing somewhat through redistricting in 1970 and 1980.
While in the legislature, Erickson earned a reputation as a leader on issues relevant to education and agriculture. He allied with the Conservative Caucus at a time when the legislature was still officially nonpartisan, and later identified as a Republican when party affiliation became required of candidates.
Erickson served on the House Agriculture, Appropriations, Budget, Commerce, Education & Higher Education, Environmental Preservation, Judiciary, Labor Relations, Rules & Legislative Administration and Transportation committees, and on various other committee incarnations and subcommittees during his 22 years in office. He was chair of the House Education Committee during his final term in office, having also served previously as chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Education in 1979.
Erickson was, along with senators Dennis Frederickson, Earl Renneke and Jim Vickerman, and representatives Aubrey Dirlam, Henry Kalis and Gilbert Esau, one of the longest-serving legislators from southern Minnesota in the state's history. He was unseated by Andy Steensma in the wave of Democratic victories that swept southwestern Minnesota in the DFL Party's "Firestorm" of 1986.
State appointment and Extension Service award.
In 1968, Erickson was appointed to the Minnesota Education Council by Governor Harold LeVander, serving for several years. In 1981, he was awarded the University of Minnesota Extension Service’s Dean and Director’s Distinguished Friend of Extension Award for "superior contributions as a legislative leader in helping others understand the need for strong agricultural support."
World War II and professional service.
From the city of Hills, Erickson was a farm management instructor and vocational agriculture teacher. He served in the United States Army Infantry during World War II, being deployed in the Asiatic theatre for two years. Prior to being elected to the legislature, he was also a member of the Rock County Fair Board.

Kundali (TV series)

Kundali is an Indian-produced television soap opera that originally aired on Metro Gold under DD Metro in 2002. After the channel closed, the series was taken over by STAR Plus, and aired from the beginning. Due to its popularity among audiences, the series is currently re-airing on TV Asia channel in USA, every Friday at 8pm EST. 
The series is produced by one of the popular Indian television production house, Balaji Telefilms, and directed by Ekta Kapoor.
Concept.
The story centers on two sisters, Aarti and Vidhi, whose lives are governed by their parents' decision to get them married only to men having horoscopes that perfectly match theirs.
Aarti (Nivedita Bhattacharya) is the mature and responsible elder sister while Vidhi (Prachi Shah) is the impulsive, slightly childish but basically loving younger one. As luck would have it, the sisters find suitable matches in Viraj (Anupam Bhattacharya) and Abhishek (Yash Tonk), two brothers who are devoted to each other. But there is a twist: because of their parents' insistence on matching horoscopes, Aarti, the elder sister, is married to Abhishek, the younger brother; while the younger sister Vidhi gets married to the elder brother Viraj. This leads to a few awkward situations, but the couples are basically quite happy. However, a series of trying circumstances overcomes the lives of the four, threatening to tear their most valuable relationships apart. How they overcome these challenges, and how their mutual love prevails in the end, forms the story of Kundali.

<doc id="21596655" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21596655" title="HMS Frolic (1806)">
HMS Frolic (1806)

HMS "Frolic" was an 18-gun "Cruizer"-class brig-sloop of the Royal Navy. She was built by Boole, of Bridport and was launched on 9 February 1806. Although she took part in the capture of Martinique, Guadaloupe, and Saint Martin, she appears to have had an uneventful career until 8 October 1812, when the American sloop captured her after a fierce fight. Later that day the British recaptured "Frolic" and captured "Wasp". "Frolic" was broken up in 1813.
Career.
On 26 October 1807, Tsar Alexander I of Russia declared war on Great Britain. The official news did not arrive there until 2 December, at which time the British declared an embargo on all Russian vessels in British ports. "Frolic" was one of some 70 vessels that shared in the seizure of the 44-gun Russian frigate "Speshnoy" ("Speshnyy"), then in Portsmouth harbour. The British seized the Russian storeship "Wilhelmina" ("Vilghemina") at the same time. The Russian vessels were carrying the payroll for Vice-Admiral Dmitry Senyavin’s squadron in the Mediterranean.
"Frolic", under Commander Thomas Whinyates, sailed for the West Indies on 21 February 1808. There she participated in the Invasion of Martinique in February 1809, and then in the invasion of Guadeloupe. In 1847 the Admiralty authorized the issuance of the Naval General Service Medal with clasps "Martinique" and "Guadaloupe".
On 17 February 1810 "Frolic", , and joined Captain William Charles Fahie of and his force at the surrender of Saint Martin.
On 14 June 1810, "Frolic" and "Freya" (or "Freija") arrived at Sombrero Island in the West Indies. The Admiralty had sent them there to assess separately and independently the survival prospects for someone landed at this place without food and water. Captain Warwick Lake of "Recruit" had marooned an impressed seaman, Robert Jeffrey, there on 13 December 1807, and was now the subject of an Admiralty investigation. They reported back that survival prospects were poor. As it turned out, Jeffrey was alive, a passing American vessel having rescued him. Still, a court-martial dismissed Lake from the Royal Navy.
"Frolic" vs. "Wasp".
In October 1812 the "Frolic" was serving on the North American station, protecting a convoy of six merchantmen off Virginia. On a passage from the Bay of Honduras, a gale dispersed the convoy and carried away "Frolic"s main top yard and sprung her main top mast.
On 18 October, while the convoy was reassembling and "Frolic" was working on the damage, a strange sail was spotted. "Frolic" sent the convoy on its way and hoisted a Spanish ensign as a ruse to buy time.
The strange sail turned out to be the , of 18 guns, commanded by Jacob Jones. The ships closed. Initially "Frolic" fired more rapidly but less accurately, but the gale damage had rendered her unmanageable. Within 40 minutes the "Wasp" had repeatedly raked "Frolic", killing 15 and wounding 43 out of the 120 seamen and boys aboard, including Whinyates. The Americans boarded "Frolic" and all resistance stopped. The Americans had 5 killed and 5 wounded.
"Frolic" was only temporarily in American hands. Later that day the British 74-gun captured both ships. Captain John Poo Beresford of "Poictiers" restored Whinyates to command of "Frolic". The subsequent court martial for the loss of the ship honorably acquitted Whinyates, his officers and his men.
Fate.
"Frolic" was recommissioned later in October under Lieutenant Andrew Mitchell (acting). His commission as commander was confirmed on 24 August 1813. earlier, on 20 July 1813, "Frolic" was one of four British vessels sharing in the capture of the American ship "Fame".
"Frolic" continued in service until being broken up at Portsmouth in November 1813.

DTNB

Beta dystrobrevin also known as DTNB is a protein which in humans is encoded by the DTNB gene.
Function.
This gene encodes dystrobrevin beta, a component of the dystrophin-associated protein complex (DPC). The DPC consists of dystrophin and several integral and peripheral membrane proteins, including dystroglycans, sarcoglycans, syntrophins and dystrobrevin alpha and beta. The DPC localizes to the sarcolemma and its disruption is associated with various forms of muscular dystrophy. Dystrobrevin beta is thought to interact with syntrophin and the DP71 short form of dystrophin. Alternatively spliced transcript variants encoding different isoforms have been identified.

Chrome alum

Chrome alum or Chromium(III) potassium sulfate is the potassium double sulfate of chromium. Its chemical formula is KCr(SO4)2 and it is commonly found in its dodecahydrate form as KCr(SO4)2·12(H2O). It was formerly used in leather tanning.
Production and properties.
Chromium alum is produced from chromate salts or from ferrochromium alloys. Concentrated aqueous solutions of potassium dichromate can be reduced, usually with sulfur dioxide but also with alcohols or formaldehyde, in the presence of sulfuric acid at temperatures <40 °C. Alternatively and less commonly, ferrochromium alloys can be dissolved in sulfuric acid and, after precipitation of the ferrous sulfate, the chrome alum crystallizes upon addition of potassium sulfate. Chromium alum crystallizes in regular octahedra with flattened corners and is very soluble in water. The solution reddens litmus and is an astringent. Aqueous solutions are dark violet and turns green when it is heated above 50°C. In addition to the dodecahydrate, the hexahydrate KCr(SO4)2·6H2O, dihydrate KCr(SO4)2·2H2O, and the monohydrate KCr(SO4)2·H2O are known.
Uses.
Chromium alum is used in the tanning of leather as chromium(III) stabilizes the leather by cross linking the collagen fibers within the leather. However, this application is obsolete because the simpler chromium(III) sulfate is preferred.
It was also used in gelatine emulsions in photographic film as hardener.

However on March 11, 2009, Georgia decided to withdraw from Eurovision 2009, stating that EBU had been pressured into wanting to change the lyrics by Russia. The EBU stated the song's lyrics breached their guidelines regarding political messages.
On 10 March 2009, the European Broadcasting Union ruled that the song lyrics "do not comply with Section 4 Rule 9 of the Rules of the 54th Eurovision Song Contest, and cannot take part in the competition as such", which meant that Georgia would have had to rewrite the song or choose another entry.

Church of Saint Lazarus, Larnaca

The Church of Saint Lazarus (), is a late-9th century church in Larnaca, Cyprus. It belongs to the Church of Cyprus, an autocephalous Greek Orthodox Church.
The Church of Saint Lazarus is named for New Testament figure Lazarus of Bethany, the subject of a miracle recounted in the Gospel of John, in which Jesus raises him from the dead. According to Orthodox tradition, sometime after the Resurrection of Christ, Lazarus was forced to flee Judea because of rumoured plots on his life and came to Cyprus. There he was appointed by Paul and Barnabas as the first Bishop of Kition (present-day Larnaca). He is said to have lived for thirty more years and on his death was buried there for the second and last time. The Church of Agios Lazaros was built over the reputed (second) tomb of Lazarus.
History and architecture.
Tradition says that the place of Lazarus' tomb was lost during the period of Arab rule beginning in 649. In 890, a tomb was found in Larnaca bearing the inscription "Lazarus the friend of Christ". Emperor Leo VI of Byzantium had Lazarus' remains transferred to Constantinople in 898. The transfer was apostrophized by Arethas, Bishop of Caesarea, and is commemorated by the Orthodox Church each year on October 17. The transferred relics were later looted by the Fourth Crusade in the early 13th century and were brought to Marseille but subsequently lost.
In recompense to Larnaca for the translation, Emperor Leo had the Church of St. Lazarus erected over Lazarus' tomb in the late 9th to early 10th centuries. It is one of three Byzantine churches which have survived in Cyprus; the other two are the Church of the Apostle Barnabas near Salamis, and the church that was built in the walkway leading from the Epiphanios to the font.
The church is an elongated building measuring 31.5 x 14.5 m with a tripartite sanctuary, semicircular apses internally and three-sided externally and a five-sided apse in the center. The interior structure of the church is divided into three aisles with bulky double pillars and arched openings going through them. These pillars bear the weight of the domes thus forming the central aisle while the north and south aisles bear a semi-cylindrical roof, intersected by cross-vaults. The stonework of the church consists mainly of square limestone block about a meter in thickness. The church has an open porch, from which steps descend into the church.
Under Frankish and Venetian rule (the 13th to 16th centuries), the church became Roman Catholic. A stone covered portico ("stoa") of Gothic style was added on its south side during this time.
The three imposing domes of this Orthodox Basilica Church and the original bell tower were destroyed, probably in the first years of Ottoman rule (1571 AD), when the church was turned into a mosque. In 1589, the Ottomans sold it back to the Orthodox, probably because of its Christian cemetery. For the next two hundred years it was used for both Orthodox and Catholic services. The porch bears traces of Greek, Latin, and French inscriptions. In 1857, after the Ottoman authorities again allowed Cypriot churches to have bell towers, the church's bell-tower was rebuilt in a Latinate style.
The woodcarving of the unique baroque iconostasis of the church was done between 1773 and 1782 by Chatzisavvas Taliadorou. The iconostasis was gold-plated between 1793 and 1797. Some of the icons were painted towards the end of the 18th century by Michael Proskynetes from Marathasa. Icon painter Hatzimichael completed the iconography of the iconostasis in 1797. Some of the wood-carved furniture (including a Rococo pulpit on one pillar for Catholic use) and icons on the walls are from the 17th century.
A fire in 1970 damaged much of the interior, including extensive damage to a section of the iconostasis together with the corresponding icons. The iconostasis has been partially restored and was re-plated with gold between 1972 and 1974. During the subsequent renovations of the church, on November 2, 1972, human remains were discovered in a marble sarcophagus under the altar, and were identified as part of the saint's relics (not all having been removed to Constantinople, apparently).
Traditions.
On Lazarus Saturday, eight days before Easter, the icon of Saint Lazarus is taken in procession through the streets of Larnaca.

First Love (Emmy the Great album)

First Love is the first studio album from the London singer-songwriter Emma-Lee Moss, better known by her stage name Emmy the Great. It was released on 9 February 2009 on the UK-based indie label Close Harbour Records.
Background.
Moss explains that she never chose to write any of the album's songs any certain way, "they just came out". She does, however, admit that "...breaking up with my boyfriend when I did had a huge influence." She describes the album as "a record of the time that it was made, and the time I spent waiting for it to come out, and now that time is over. It's actually quite weird that other people are only just hearing it. Members of my family will bring up a song and I’ll be like, 'that is so 2008.'"
The first single, "We Almost Had A Baby", was released on 10 November 2008. In January 2009, a promotional version of the album was leaked on a number of music forums. Moss then posted a blog on her MySpace page asking people not to download it, saying that the first run of promos had been of the wrong master, and were of a lower quality than the album that would be released officially.
Music videos were released for "We Almost Had A Baby", "First Love" and "MIA".
Critical response.
The album met with generally positive reviews on release. British webzine Drowned in Sound praised it as "a triumph, with a maturity beyond her years, and with a humour no less enjoyable for being subtle", while "The Guardian" described Moss' style as "ultra-wordy, but also articulate and interesting." "NME", however, was more equivocal, criticising her "constant stance of diary-entry victimhood" as becoming "more grating than engaging". Moss' songwriting was widely praised, with webzine TwistedEar saying that her lyrics are "Emmy the Great's secret weapon, and save "First Love" from mediocrity."
The album was ranked at No. 7 on the "New York Times" "Albums of the Year 2009" list.

Taxonomy of the Gastropoda (Ponder &amp; Lindberg, 1997)

The taxonomy of the Gastropoda, as revised by Winston Ponder and David R. Lindberg in 1997, is an older taxonomy of the class Gastropoda, the class of molluscs consisting of all snails and slugs. The full name of the work in which this taxonomy was published is "Towards a phylogeny of gastropod molluscs: an analysis using morphological characters."
This taxonomy assigns the various Gastropods into ranked categories, such as sub-orders and families, but does not address the classification of genera or individual species. This classification scheme is based on the molluscs' internal and external shapes and forms, but did not take into account any analysis of their DNA or RNA. 
The classification below was the most recent until Bouchet and Rocroi published their revised taxonomy in 2005, which differs primarily in that the higher taxa are expressed as unranked clades where known, and termed "informal groups" or groups" where monophyly (a single lineage) has not yet been determined, and where polyphyly (more than one lineage) is suspected. 
Ponder & Lindberg (1997) used only four families to analyze the Euthyneura. Further work by Dayrat & Tillier (2002) provided a great deal of detail about the relationships between within the Euthyneura.
Ponder & Lindberg (1997) did not use Linnean taxonomical ranks in their work, but the results of their paper were widely adapted and used with Linnean taxonomical ranks by other authors. An example of such taxonomy follows:

Central Case Examination Group

The Central Case Examination Group (CCEG) was a special organization established in the People's Republic of China in 1966 under the aegis of the Politburo Standing Committee to persecute those accused of "anti-party activities". It was compared by Wang Li to the Soviet Cheka, but he noted that the CCEG had even broader powers. (Schoenhals, 1996). Its members included nearly all of the members of the Cultural Revolution Group, with which the CCEG worked closely during its investigations.
Background.
The precursor to the CCEG was the Special Case Examination Committee, an organ established by the Politburo in May 1966 to investigate the political offences of Peng Zhen, Luo Ruiqing, Lu Dingyi and Yang Shangkun. When it was found that there was a need for analysis of other cases, the committee was retained under a new name, and soon achieved a permanence as a central institution.
Role in the Cultural Revolution.
Unlike its counterpart the Cultural Revolution Group, the CCEG was to operate throughout the entire of the Cultural Revolution decade and beyond, investigating and reporting on the crimes of many of the members of the higher echelons of the Communist Party of China (CCP) and all people considered to be counterrevolutionary. The group's highest profile case was that of Liu Shaoqi, whose case was reportedly investigated by 400,000 people (including some Red Guards from Peking University), looking at over four million files. The findings of the CCEG on Liu Shaoqi were compiled into a seventy-four page report to be considered by the Twelfth Plenum of the Central Committee of the CCP that met in October 1968. It was at this plenum that Liu Shaoqi was officially expelled from the CCP. 
The CCEG's membership included most of the membership of the Cultural Revolution Group and Zhou Enlai, with Mao Zedong's wife Jiang Qing taking a particularly active role in the building of cases against individuals. In addition, other members included Wang Dongxing and Ye Qun, the wife of Lin Biao.
The CCEG was responsible to the Politburo Standing Committee, and wielded significant power in the realm of public security. It took the decisions to arrest, torture and imprison suspected 'revisionist' elements. For example, at the time of Twelfth Plenum in October 1968, 88 fully fledged or 'alternate' members of the CC were under CCEG investigation.
By autumn 1967, the CCEG had become too large an operation for its existing structure, and so the group was subdivided into a First Office and a Second Office. The First Office, led by Wang Dongxing, took responsibility for the cases from the initial phases of the Cultural Revolution, including cases surrounding Peng Zhen and his supporters. The Second Office, led by Yang Chengwu and (following Yang's demise in March 1968) General Huang Yongsheng, was solely concerned with the cases of members of the military. It took over several cases of senior PLA soldiers, including that of Marshal He Long. In 1968, a Third Office was established under Xie Fuzhi to investigate the May 16th Conspiracy, involving some members of the Cultural Revolution Group. The Third Office would later take on other cases of conspiracy groups.
Although there were suggestions that the CCEG should be dissolved at the same time as the Cultural Revolution Group, in 1969, it was retained as an institution for the remainder of the Cultural Revolution decade, continuing its investigative role. In 1970, the group started to examine the case against Chen Boda (who by this point had fallen from political favour), and in 1971 the CCEG also began to investigate Lin Biao. In 1975, in an effort to bring the Cultural Revolution to a close, Mao ordered that the CCEG conclude its major cases swiftly and release of some prisoners. This led to the release of around 300 prisoners in the middle of 1975.
Dissolution.
The last case assigned to the CCEG was the case of the 'Gang of Four'. Jiang Qing, once an active member of the CCEG, came under investigation by the very apparatus she had been involved in. After completing its analysis of the 'Gang of Four' case, the Central Case Examination Group was formally dissolved after thirteen years of operation at the Eleventh Central Committee's Third Plenum, held in December 1978.

Polish 9th Fighter Regiment

The Polish 9th Fighter Regiment ("Polish: 9 Pułk Lotnictwa Myśliwskiego") was a fighter regiment established in 1944 in Malbork that was a part of the Air Force of the Polish Army. The regiment was stationed in Debrzno until it was disbanded on December 31, 2000 in Zegrze Pomorskie.
History.
On August 7, 1944, the Soviet Red Army issued an executive order for the formation of the 1st Mixed Air Corps ("Polish: 1 Meszany Korpus Lotniczy") in the regions of Kazan and Kharkiv. The Corps was created from September 1944 to January 1945.
The Corps included the 3rd Fighter Division, which was formed on January 20, 1944 from the 10th Training Brigade of the 2nd Air Army. This division consisted of the 11th and 10th Fighter Regiments, which had been previously been stationed in Karłowo, as well as the newly created 9th Fighter Regiment. The division was equipped with fighter aircraft, and placed under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Wasyl Dobraszow in Krasnogród. 
On May 11, 1959, the Defense Minister, General Marian Spychalski, made an official state inspection of the regiment. He was accompanied by the Head of General Staff General Jerzy Bordziłowski and Jan Frey-Bielecki, the Commander of the Air Force.
From September 28 to October 8, 1959, the regiment participated in the Air Force's championship air games in Wroclaw.
On July 22, 1987, Defense Minister General Florian Siwicki made a surprise inspection of the regiment. After conducting combat preparedness drills and reserve mobilization exercises, he concluded that the regiment showed high efficiency, willingness, and enthusiasm in carrying out their duties
On June 2, 1991, the regiment welcomed Pope John Paul II on behalf of President Lech Wałęsa. During the subsequent Mass, which took place on an air field in Zegrze Pomorskie, the Pope addressed the soldiers, saying, ""Ci wszyscy, którzy sprawie Ojczyzny oddani, służą w wojsku, niech uważają siebie za sługi bezpieczeństwa i wolności narodów. Po raz pierwszy dane mi jest - podczas odwiedzin w Ojczyźnie - przemówić do żołnierzy na specjalnym spotkaniu.""
On June 14, 1996, President Aleksander Kwaśniewski visited the regiment while he was visiting Koszalin Voivodeship.
Structure.
The regiment consisted of the regimental command and staff, two fighter squadrons, a technical squadron, a supply battalion, and a support and communications battalion. Their proper names, in Polish, were as follows:
The technical squadron had a variety of duties, including servicing airports, storing missiles, and maintaining and refurbishing aircraft, engines, radio and electrical equipment, and weapons. The supply battalion's duties include shuttle service, the upkeep and operation of company cars, and protection.
Equipment.
During the sixty year operating history of the regiment, it operated a number of different Soviet- and Polish-built aircraft. These aircraft were mostly jet fighters and various forms of training aircraft, but also included a single transport helicopter.
The Regiment operated the Lim-1, Lim-2, and SB Lim-2 versions of the MiG-15, as well as the Lim-5 version of the MiG-17. All "Lim"-designated MiG aircraft were manufactured in Poland. In addition to the listed aircraft, the regiment also operated the 57 mm AZP S-60 anti-aircraft gun.

Chennai Monorail

Chennai Monorail is a rail-based transit system for the Indian city of Chennai. It is proposed in the Long-term Urban Transportation Scheme of Second Master Plan by CMDA. The state government has announced plans to introduce monorail across City to reduce traffic congestion and to increase the share of public transport in the urban transport network. The aim is to increase the share of public transport in Chennai from 27% to 46% by 2026.
History.
The Tamil Nadu Government invited bids for the ambitious 'Elevated Monorail Mass Rapid Transit System' (EMMRTS) monorail project covering over 300 km to be implemented at a single phase. Soon after a public interest litigation was filed in High Court, Chennai against awarding of the contract and the court ordered the government not to award the final contract without its prior permission. Since chances of the metro rail getting approval by central government which consisted of arch rival DMK, were remote, the less expensive mono rail was preferred. A total of 18 corridors had been proposed. Had the project been executed, it would have been the biggest monorail project in the planet dwarfing any other monorail in the world. However, soon she was voted out of power and the monorail project was shelved. Again, when the new AIADMK government came to power in 2011, the current Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, through the Governor Surjit Singh Barnala's address to the assembly, stated that the Chennai Monorail project of around 300 km will be revived and would supplement the existing metro rail systems that were implemented with assistance from Japanese loans and central government funding.
Proposed corridors in 2006.
The following 18 corridors were proposed to be completely built within 18 months. 
Total Route Length – 333.1 km<br>
Common Length – 32.9 km<br>
Track Length – 300.2 km
Corridors proposed in second master plan.
Two corridors have been proposed in the Second Master Plan by CMDA. These corridors have been proposed as a feeder service for Chennai MRTS, Chennai Metro, Chennai Suburban Railway and Metropolitan Transport Corporation.
Corridor 1: Dams Road Junction - Royapettah - Thiruvanmayur - Adyar - Guindy (Halda Junction)
Corridor 2: Lighthouse MRTS Station - Anna flyover - Kilpauk - Perambur
Planned corridors (Phase I).
The Four corridors have been identified based on a feasibility study prepared by the Pallavan Transport Consultancy Services Ltd. A crisscrossing network of monorail corridors, running to a total length of 111 km with four corridors, is being planned by the State government and plans to complete the first phase of the monorail project within two years. The network includes a 54-km link between Vandalur and Puzhal, which when completed would be the longest anywhere in the world. The developer will be responsible to (DBFOT) design, construct, finance, own, maintain and transfer the project after a period of 30 years. Monorail stations would be aesthetically designed, with minimal use of concrete. Initially, a four-car monorail train is expected to run along an elevated narrow guide way that would come up on the road median. The capacity of one train would be about 560 passengers, which translates to a capacity of about 10,000 passengers per hour per direction.
Revised corridors (Phase I).
The State government has decided to drop one of the four monorail lines that were supposed to be built in the city. While originally an ambitious 111-km long Phase-I network was proposed to be constructed the revised target means the monorail grid would be only 57-km. The corridor from Vandalur to Puzhal via Avadi (54 km) has been axed because it runs through "undeveloped areas with no pre-existing traffic in the alignment", making it "financially unviable". If it had been built, it would have been the longest monorail corridor in the world.
The revised 57-km long Phase-I of Chennai Monorail is estimated to cost 80,500 million. It is proposed to constitute a network of three elevated corridors –Vandalur to Velachery via Tambaram East (23 km); Poonamallee to Kathipara via Porur (16 km); and Poonamallee to Vadapalani via Valasarawakkam (18 km).The fourth line may be considered in the subsequent phases of the project.He said several monorail manufacturers had expressed the non-viability of building a 54-km monorail line (Vandalur to Puzhal) using existing technologies even during the previous tendering process. In the second phase, Asia’s longest monorail corridor from Vandalur to Puzhal would be taken up.
The much-anticipated monorail is expected to have nearly three dozen stations in Chennai and its suburbs. The stations will come up at places that are good crowd generation points. The locations under consideration will have sufficient space for accommodating a station. The accessibility to these stations is also taken into consideration. An expert team was formed to scout for monorail stations sites. The team, comprising personnel from MTC, PTCS and a private consultancy firm, were given a time period of ten days to study and come up with sites where monorail stations can come up. Poonamallee and Vadapalani stations are expected to get monorail depots, where the monorails could be berthed and maintained. The Kathipara station will boast of the multi-modal transport system with the monorail integrating with MRTS, Metro Rail, and EMU service.
Revised corridors (2014).
The government's realigned monorail route will connect Poonamallee in the "northwest" of Chennai and Vandalur in the "far south" through two corridors that will meet near the Kathipara intersection.
corridor-1 (Poonamallee - Porur - Vadapalani/Kathipara)
Work on the first corridor is expected to begin in August-2014, with the government having issued tenders for the project. When completed, the 21 km first corridor will link Poonamallee and Kathipara, via Kumaranchavadi, Porur and Nandambakkam, with a wishbone line forking off to Vadapalani
corridor-2 (Vandalur - Medavakkam - Velacheri - Kathipara) 
The government is expected to soon announce the alignment for the second corridor between Vandalur and Kathipara, via Perungalathur, Irumbuliyur, Tambaram East, Sembakkam, Medavakkam and Velacherry.
Revised plan cost and funding model
In 2011, the State Government issued a request for qualification (RFQ) for 111-km phase I network cost ₹166.50 billion or ₹1.50 billion for each km.
However, in the (2014) revised plan, the Government will start with the 20.68 km monorail at ₹1564.3 million per km.
The revised route plan comes at a slightly higher cost per km than earlier planned, but, will be offered to private companies under the Design, Build, Finance, Operate and Transfer basis. This means there will not be any financial commitment for the State Government.
As per the new plan, Corridor-1 - 20.68-km from Poonamallee to Kathipara with a link from Porur to Vadaplani - is expected to cost ₹32.35 billion.
The Vandalur-Velachery corridor (more than 23-km) is expected to cost at least ₹40 billion for which the State government has decided to seek assistance from the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). 
Stations (to be updated pending announcement for updated corridor-2 alignment).
A total of 37 stations on paper, in reality it will be 34 as the monorails running between Poonamallee and Kathipara and Poonamallee to Vadapalani stretches will be halting at two common stations (Karayanchavadi and Kumananchavadi besides the source station Poonamallee). The first Corridor – Vandalur to Velachery (23 km) — will have 14 stations, 12 stations will come up along the Poonamallee - Vadapalani Corridor (18 km) and 11 along the third corridor – Poonamallee to Kathipara junction (16 km).
Project cost.
The 111-km long, first phase of the Chennai Monorail project is proposed at a cost of 166.50 billion. The per-kilometre cost of the Chennai monorail will be around 1.50 billion. The revised 54-km-long, phase-I of the monorail is estimated to cost 80.50 billion.

Yamli.com ( "", " dictates") is an Internet start-up focused on addressing the problems specific to the Arabic web. Yamli currently offers two main products: the smart Arabic keyboard, and Yamli Arabic Search. The smart Arabic keyboard allows users to type Arabic without an Arabic keyboard from within their web browser. This technology is based on a real-time transliteration engine which converts words typed with Latin characters to their closest Arabic equivalent. Yamli Arabic search is a search engine focused on providing more relevant search results for an Arabic query by expanding it to its most frequently used Latin representations.
Products.
Smart Arabic keyboard.
Yamli's Smart Arabic Keyboard was launched in November 2007. It allows users to type Arabic by spelling their words phonetically using Latin characters. The real time transliteration engine is designed to be:
It is also possible for other websites and blogs to use Yamli's typing technology through a free Javascript API. The Arabic Keyboard API allows a website publisher to easily convert text input fields to accept Arabic input in Latin form.
Yamli search.
Arabic and Arabic dialects content on the web exists in two forms: in Arabic Script and in ad hoc Latin phonetic representations (Arabic Chat Alphabet). Finding relevant content for an Arabic query on a traditional search engine can be difficult because it requires trying many Latin variations of that query. Yamli Search seeks to address this problem by expanding an Arabic search query to its most frequently used Latin spellings. The search query is forwarded to a traditional search engine, returning a larger number of relevant results than the original query would have.
The following are examples of Latin query expansions automatically performed by Yamli Search:
Yamli Search queries are forwarded to Google for web and news, Wikipedia for encyclopedic searches, Bing for image searches and YouTube for movie and video searches.
History.
Yamli's typing technology originated during the July 2006 war in Lebanon, when co-founder Habib Haddad was looking for news about the war online. Without access to an Arabic keyboard and not being used to one, Haddad had difficulties finding up-to-date information, which is generally first available in Arabic. After working on prototypes of an Arabic transliteration engine for several months, Haddad, along with co-founder Imad Jureidini, founded Language Analytics LLC in July 2007. In November 2007, Language Analytics launched Yamli.com, featuring the Smart Arabic Keyboard to allow users to type Arabic without an Arabic keyboard, as well as a basic search engine front end to Google. This first search engine did not include the expanded query capabilities of Yamli Arabic Search. The typing technology was made to third-party websites in March 2008 in the form of a free API. The search engine was updated to include the query expansion capabilities in December 2008.
Awards.
Yamli has won the "Best Web Technology Award" at the "Pan Arab Web Awards 2008", and the audience choice award at the WebInnovatorsGroup 17. Yamli founder Habib Haddad was featured on the World Economic Forum's 2009 Young Global Leader List.

Thomas Michael Whalen III

Thomas Michael Whalen III, also known as Thomas M. Whalen III, and more simply, Tom Whalen, (1934–2002) was a three-term mayor of Albany, New York. A native of Albany, he was an attorney. He graduated from Manhattan College and Albany Law School.
Whalen had served as a city court judge from 1969 to 1975. In 1981, as part of Erastus Corning's "Team for the Future", he was elected as President of the Albany Common Council. His election to the Common Council's Presidency, done with the full support of then Mayor Erastus Corning, set the stage for Whalen's takeover of City Hall.
After Mayor Corning's 1983 death in Boston, and in accordance with Albany's charter, Whalen, as Common Council President, became Mayor. At the time of his ascendacy to office, New York State Comptroller Ned Regan was preparing to impose a Financial Control Board over the City of Albany. Whalen quickly set about establishing proper financial controls so that Albany could maintain control over its own finances. By all accounts he was successful.
He was a delegate to the 1984 Democratic National Convention. He was mayor during the city's year long Tricentennial celebration, which included a restoration of the carillon of Albany City Hall.
He was elected on his own in 1985 and re-elected in 1989. He retired from public office on December 31, 1993, and, after an unsuccessful nomination to the federal bench, he returned to the practice of law. He died in a car accident at the age of 68.
Legacy.
Whalen is credited with leading a broad revitalization of both the City of Albany and the Capital District through the 1980s and into the early 1990s. His tenure is noted for its focus on prudent financial and civil service reform, opening up city hall, and using the arts and the city park system as a catalyst for growth.
Whalen was involved in improving the City's image both domestically and worldwide. In 1991, he founded the Albany-Tula Alliance with Tula, then a city in the U.S.S.R., now Russia.
The City was designated an "All-American City" under his leadership, attained the highest possible bond rating from Moody's and hosted many successful downtown cultural events.
The Irish internship program at the New York State Assembly is named in his honor. This started after Whalen joined the staff at University College Cork in 2000, and he decided to found an internship program for that college's students to go to the College of Saint Rose for experiential education in Albany. Sadly, he died in 2002 just as the first "Irish Interns" were set to arrive in Albany.
Whalen is still remembered for his political opposition to the preservation of the pine barrens on the outskirts of Albany, which he wanted developed.
Whalen was eulogized at Albany Law, his "alma mater". An award is granted by the Neighborhood Resource Center in his honor. The "Thomas M.

Cambridge University Eco Racing

Cambridge University Eco Racing (CUER) is the UK's leading solar car racing team. The team of 60 Cambridge students design, build and race solar powered vehicles. Founded in 2007, its first prototype vehicle, "Affinity" became the first solar-powered car to drive legally on UK roads. The team competes in the biennial World Solar Challenge. CUER's race vehicle for the 2013 race, 'Resolution', is known for its innovative tracking plate design, and unusual teardrop shape.
Background.
Cambridge University Eco Racing is based in the University's Department of Engineering and comprises around 80 undergraduate members from several departments of Cambridge University. As well as having a large student body, the team is strongly supported by a number of academic and industrial advisers, including Hermann Hauser and Tony Purnell.
The team was founded in 2007 by Martin McBrien, inspired by the solar car team at MIT. Its first vehicle, "Affinity", was designed and constructed in early 2008 and was used as a prototype and display vehicle rather than for serious competition. In June 2008, "Affinity" was driven from Land's End to John O'Groats to raise awareness of sustainable energy. As part of the End to End venture, it was endorsed by the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency to legally drive on UK roads, and became the first such vehicle to qualify. CUER runs outreach events at local schools and has been featured in a wide range of local, national and international media.
In July 2008, work began on the second generation CUER vehicle, "Endeavour". Following design work by a number of students in the Engineering Department, and with the support of the advisory board, the team competed in the 2009 World Solar Challenge, a 3000 km marathon across Australia. They came 14th, of 26 competitors, after a battery failure severely hindered their chances of competing effectively. "Endeavour"'s 2009 entry was launched by Jenson Button at the Goodwood Festival of Speed.
Over the next two years, they continued redesigning and refining Endeavour, resulting in a car with much improved aerodynamic properties and more reliable batteries. The team used CFD simulations to make minor tweaks to the canopy, and tested the car extensively at a local airfield, before heading out to the next World Solar Challenge in October 2011. There, after the hardest race on record due to a combination of thunderstorms and bush fires, they came 25th out of 37 teams.
Since then, the team has been designing a radical new vehicle, Resolution, to compete in the WSC in 2013.
Competition.
CUER has competed in both the World Solar Challenge 2009 and 2011, coming 14th and 25th respectively. In future, CUER hope to enter the North American Solar Challenge and the South African Solar Challenge but the current focus is on preparations for the 2013 World Solar Challenge. Historically, CUER had intended to compete in the Zero Rally Africa in January 2009; however, this contest was subsequently cancelled.
Vehicles.
"Affinity".
"Affinity" is CUER's first vehicle, built as a prototype and based on a shape taken from MIT's "Manta Elite" solar car. Affinity became the UK's first road legal solar car, successfully driving from Land's End to John o'Groats as part of CUER's "End to End" tour in 2008.
"Endeavour".
The second generation vehicle, designed and built to compete in the World Solar Challenge. First entering the World Solar Challenge in 2009, the team lead by Anthony Law raced across the Outback of Australia marking the teams highest placed finish to date. Endeavour was modified and take to Australia again in 2011 by the team led by Emil Hewage.
"Resolution".
Designed and built in under 12 months, Resolution's innovative aerodynamic shape breaks away from the classic 'table top' design seen in most entrants to the World Solar Challenge.
Conferences and sponsorship.
CUER regularly attends industry conferences. They have been represented at the Raymond James’ 4th Annual European Investors North American Equities Conference, and the Exhibition of Advanced Manufacturing and Engineering at Hethel Engineering Centre and Marketforce’s ‘Renewables 2008’. CUER also exhibited in Cambridge at the ARM Partner Meeting, Cambridge Climate’s ‘Entrepreneurship for a Zero-Carbon Society’ conference and CIR’s ‘Solar Smart HEAT’ event.
Further afield, CUER exhibited amongst the Europe’s top 100 Cleantech companies at the Guardian/Library House Essential Cleantech conference, and presented at ‘Commercialising Photovoltaics’ organised by Renewables East.
CUER's major sponsors include Cambridge Precision, Jaguar Land Rover and Schlumberger. In the past, it has been sponsored by Hewlett Packard.

Amador High School

Amador High School is located in Sutter Creek, CA and is one of 2 high schools in Amador County. It is a public school that serves about 800 students in grades 9-12. Originally known as "Amador County High School" at its inception in 1911, the school's name changed to "Sutter Creek Union High School" in 1916, reverting to "Amador County High School" in 1949, at the request of that year's graduating class. In 1984, upon completion of the three school districts in the county merging, the name was changed to "Amador High School".
Academics.
California uses the Academic Performance Index (API) to measure annual school performance and year-to-year improvement. Amador High School had an API growth score of 791 in 2009. Amador High School's 2009 base score was 788, however the school did not meet its 2009 school-wide growth target.
In 2008, Amador High School had 23 students for every full-time equivalent teacher. The California average is 21 students per full-time equivalent teacher.
Under No Child Left Behind, a school makes Adequate Yearly Progress (AYP) if it achieves the minimum levels of improvement determined by the state of California in terms of student performance and other accountability measures. Amador High School made AYP in 2009.
School statistics.
Scores on the California Standards Test follow:
Athletics.
Amador High School is home of the Buffaloes (Thundering Herd). They are part of the Mother Lode League and a member of the California Interscholastic Federation (Sac-Joaquin Section). They are well known for their superior Basketball program, as well as Girls Soccer. Amador also offers many other sports, such as football, baseball, wrestling, and swimming. Throughout the 1980s they had the most successful track and field program in the Mother Lode League with at times over 70 athletes participating on one team. The schools pee-wee football & cheer team is called the "Amador Jr. Buffaloes". Current UC Davis Football Defensive Assistant Brian Bellotti was a member of the Amador High School Football Team from 2001 to 2003. Brian Bellotti is most well known for wrestling and defeating a local wild black bear while a senior at Amador High School. In 2011, the boys basketball team made it to the Sac-Joaquin Section Championships, held at Arco Arena. The team unfortunately did not win, but became the runner-up. Amador's Girl Cross Country won the Sac-Joaquin Sections in 2012-2013, and continued on to state.
Rivalry with Argonaut.
Known as the "Big Game" officially but to some Amador County residence it's also called the "Cross-County Clash", the towns of Sutter Creek and Jackson have watched Argonaut High School & Amador High School face off in Football, Basketball, and Baseball for more than 50 years. It's one of California's oldest & most memorable high school rivalries. Students used to participate by defacing the others school property but due to police calls and threats of exploitation they stopped. The town of Sutter Creek supports Amador by having the schools colors displayed in various town shops & colored streamers hung in the town square. The same goes for Jackson but instead of Amador Blue & White they have Argonaut Green & Gold. In football, both teams play for the coveted "Rotary Bell", whoever wins the big game will have possession over the bell for one full calendar year until the two teams meet again.
Theater.
Amador High School, while in a rural area, has an excellent drama department, mainly due to its drama teacher, Giles Turner, who has been a teacher at the school for almost 50 years. The school holds many shows throughout the year including: improv, solo acting, duo acting, winter musical, student written one-act, spring show, beginning drama one-acts, and the final show of the year, Revue, a variety show. Each year Amador Drama competes in the Lenaea Drama festival in Folsom. In 2013, they took home a gold medal for student director and best original one-act, as well as a silver for one-act performance and a bronze for duo acting. In the spring of each year, Amador hosts the Mother Lode Drama Festival, which invites schools from all across northern/middle California to compete in solo and duo acting, as well as one-acts and vocal. Many other community shows are put on through the Amador Theater Department.
Band.
Amador High School's band is one of honor. The first band in all of Amador county was started in Sutter Creek in 1914-15 school year, and the upcoming school year mark the 100th anniversary of bands in the county. The band has had a number of directors, most notably that of Hank King, who was the director at the school on and off for over forty years. Then in 2005, Christopher Tootle became the main director for the ailing school band program, and has since built it back up to over fifty students, one most notably is the mascot for the school, so therefore having the mascot playing in the band, a unique feature of the marching band. The marching band is always a crowd favorite, and plays many favorites, from "Louie Louie" of Kingsmen fame, to modern favorites such as "Seven Nation Army" by the White Stripes. The concert band has always been a favorite among Amador County residents, and participates in the Disneyland Performing Arts program, going every two years. Other events the band goes to include: The Italian Pinic Parade, the Parade of Lights, Forum Featival, PacWest, and many more. The standard uniform for marching is of white tops with silver buttons, navy pants, black shoes and black shakos. They also have throwback uniforms, which have a lighter blue pants and white pith helmets. Concert attire is black blouses and skirts for the ladies and tuxedos for the gentleman. The band has received many honors and awards, and is unique among high school bands.

Béké

Béké or beke is a Creole term to describe a descendant of the early European, usually French, settlers in the French Antilles.
Origin.
The origin of the term is not clear and several explanations have been proposed. It could be a word from the Igbo language where it describes a European. A local tradition holds that it is derived from the question
« eh bé qué ? » (« eh bien quoi ? », similar to "What's up"), an expression picked up from the French settlers. Another explanation is that its origin lies in the term « blanc des quais » ("a White from the quay") as the White colonists and merchants controlled the ports. In contrast, the "Blanc Péyi" is used for White people born in the Antilles and adapted to the creole life who are not descendants of the first White settlers.
In Guadeloupe one theory speaks also of the "Blanc Créole" or "Blanc Kréyol", abbreviated to BK, "ergo" Béké.
Class problems.
The békés represent a small minority in the French Antilles; however, they control much of the local industry. The 2009 French Caribbean general strikes were to some degree aimed against the class difference that exists between the békés and the predominantly Black majority population.

Institute for Trafficked, Exploited, and Missing Persons

The Institute for Trafficked, Exploited, and Missing Persons (ITEMP) provides services to victims of forced labor, sexual exploitation, and other forms of modern-day slavery in Guatemala. Local authorities work with La Asociación Nuestros Ahijados in the rescue process, and rely on ITEMP to provide short- and long-term rehabilitation for rescued victims. ITEMP is unique in Guatemala, because the program works with adults as well as children. ITEMP fights trafficking and exploitation in three distinct ways: through rescue, rehabilitation, and public education. The project also focuses on prevention through public awareness and education, as well as by hosting the annual Guatemalan National Trafficking in Persons Congress.
Activities.
ITEMP aggressively seeks custody of children being trafficked and/or exploited. The project also provides short- and long-term housing for all victims, through host families for minors, and shelter for adult victims. The rehabilitation process works to provide the tools for a better life. Counseling and education are made available for children, as well as technical and vocational training for adults. ITEMP also works to educate the people of Guatemala and the U.S. about trafficking and the terrible atrocities faced by exploited persons, and the resources available to help those who need it.
Goals.
Victims of trafficking and exploitation are coerced through fear tactics, violence, and a lack of knowledge of the resources available to them. Rescue is only the first step. The goals of ITEMP are: protection, prevention, and, on a smaller scale, prosecution. Many of those rescued are at a very high risk of falling victim to trafficking or exploitation again. Long-term rehabilitation, including education and counseling, provides tools to resist being victimized in the future and requires significant funding to ensure its success. ITEMP and Nuestros Ahijados are dedicated to the complete rehabilitation of rescued persons regardless of the amount of time it takes. Children that enter the program at the age of six or seven will be taken through the program until the completion of their education, sometimes all the way through medical or law school. Such long-term commitment is rarely available and makes ITEMP an essential asset to the people it serves.
Community cooperation.
While assisting victims is crucial, long-term solutions include educating the general public. Community cooperation is essential in the battle against modern slavery. ITEMP is currently coordinating an agreement between local hotels to refuse the rental of rooms to minors, or persons other than family members wishing to rent rooms with minors. Stories like Ana’s (see below) are all too common, and must not be tolerated.
Awareness on the part of the public creates intolerance of such atrocities being committed to those who can’t, or don’t know how to, defend themselves against exploitation. Many victims are unwilling to cooperate with authorities to prosecute traffickers because they still believe they are in danger, or do not wish to relive the terrible acts they’ve survived. ITEMP provides counseling and legal services to work with victims in the hopes of increasing prosecution of traffickers in Guatemala. ITEMP recognizes that trafficking in persons is a complex problem that requires multiple acts of intervention to eradicate exploitation of, and trafficking in persons.
ITEMP works with other programs/NGOs, as well as the Guatemalan government to better aid victims and increase prosecution of offenders. In 2008, the project hosted the first annual Guatemalan National Trafficking in Persons Congress

Salvia purpurea is a herbaceous perennial that is native to several Mexican states and south into Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. It was first described by Antonio José Cavanilles in 1793, though its use in horticulture is only recent and it is rarely sold by nurseries.
"Salvia purpurea" reaches up to 7 feet in height, less in width, with ovate yellow-green leaves that have serrated edges. Inflorescences begin appearing in mid-autumn, with the plant blooming into winter. The flowers are a pinkish purple-violet, in tight verticils that look like they are unbalanced on one side of the flower spike. The .75 inch flowers are tightly packed at the end of many flowering branches.

The Irish Second–Level Students' Union (ISSU) is Ireland's national umbrella body for second-level students working through the student council network in all second-level schools. ISSU connects, and represents post-primary school students nationwide. Providing a structured platform through which students can voice their views.
ISSU's work has three main strands: it aims to provide training, guidance and advice to empower students and equip them with the vital skills needed to become actively involved in the decision-making processes in their own school communities; and it aims to work in partnership with other organisations to bring the views of secondary school students to the attention of local and national policy-makers, as well as the media, in relation to educational issues. And our third and final aim to provide services to the membership of ISSU on the principal that control of those services lies with the membership.
ISSU was founded in August 2008, from the remains of the Union of Secondary Students (USS). It is member of the Organising Bureau of European School Student Unions (OBESSU) and the National Youth Council of Ireland.
During September 2009, ISSU modified its name from the Irish Secondary Students' Union to the Irish Second–Level Students' Union to encompass all Irish Post Primary Schools equally.
In October 2009, ISSU launched the ISSU Scholar Card - a unique student card for second-level students' aged between 12–18. The national rollout of the card began in November 2009.
Structure.
Monitoring and Advisory Committee (MAC) – The MAC acts as the backbone of the organisation. This committee oversees the work of ISSU, provides guidance to the National Student Executive, and provides advice on the finances of the organisation. This Committee is composed of representatives from Ireland's leading education & youth Organisations, past ISSU officers and is chaired by the ISSU General Secretary.
National Student Executive (NSE) – The National Student Executive (NSE) look after the day-to-day running of the organisation. Led by the ISSU President, the NSE comprises various officers elected at the ISSU AGM to look after various aspects of Student Life - Deputy President (Campaigns and Communications), Education, Welfare, Equality, Oifigeach na Gaeilge, International Officer, Student Council Support Officer, Secretary, Public Relations Officer and Honorary President. 
National Council – The National Council provides a link from the National Student Executive to the ground-roots level of the organisation, linking students via their Regional Council of Schools officer to the ISSU National Council and National Student Executive. Each region elects an ISSU Regional Council of Schools Officer. The National Council is chaired by the ISSU Student Council Support Officer who also sits on the ISSU National Student Executive and acts as the link between the two. There are 5 ISSU regional council regions - Munster Area, Leinster Area, Connaught Area, Ulster area and the greater Dublin Area.

Based loosely from the TV series of the same name, the film tells about a group of teenagers and their miseries in life and how they cope with the dramatic experiences they are facing as they undergo their everyday life.
Production.
According to Lee Mee Fung, the Executive Director of Red Films Sdn Bhd, the film which is targeted at teenagers is about "a commercial film which revolves around teenagers' conflicts and their reactions in determining their future."
The catch phrase of this film is "Hidup ini memang palat, tapi esok masih ada." The word "palat" has been featured in the promotion materials that are included in KAMI: Vol II soundtrack, as well as in the official website. However, the word has been eliminated from the further promotion materials as well as from the dialogues in the film since it was considered as a vulgar word.
This film marks the first attempt of Effendee Mazlan as the director of a commercial film, as well as Fariza Azlina Isahak, who has written the script for the first time. Among the companies that were involved in the making of this film was Hotlink and Monkey Bone Records.
Release.
"Kami" was released to 43 cinemas across Malaysia on the first day of Hari Raya, and had a tight competition with "Senario The Movie: Episode 1" which was released at the same day. Although it was predicted that it would not be able to compete with "Senario The Movie", it went to raise RM1.4 million in the first two weeks of screening and it managed to avoid the possibility of massive loss.
Critical reception.
Initial critical reception to "Kami" was generally positive reviews.
Izuan Shah from Gua.com said that "the premise of this film is very simple and interesting to grasp the attention of modern teenagers", giving the movie a rating of 8 out of 10. His compliment went to Nas Muammar who "commanded the character Abu convincingly with his natural talent" as well as Zahiril "who has the potential of a newcomer".
Nurulhisham Abdul Latiff from Berita Harian complimented all the casts for their successful performance, especially Liyana Jasmay, Nas Muammar and Zahiril. However, she further commented that "the recording style of this film is unsuitable for some audience" but "it was a fine job afterall.

At the 1930 Empire Games he won the gold medal in the heavyweight class.
McCready attracted the attention of Oklahoma State wrestling coaches when he defeated their heavyweight at a 1926 tournament in Canada. McCready came to the Stillwater, Oklahoma college, where he played football and wrestled. In three years of wrestling varsity, the 5'11", 238-pound McCready was 25-0, with all but three of his victories by pin.

In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play)

In the Next Room (or The Vibrator Play) is a play by Sarah Ruhl. It concerns the early history of the vibrator, when doctors used it as a clinical device to bring women to orgasm as treatment for "hysteria." Other themes include Victorian ignorance of female sexual desire, motherhood, breastfeeding, and jealousy. The play was nominated for three 2010 Tony Awards.
Plot summary.
Sabrina Daldry and Catherine Givings are sexually frustrated with their husbands, who creep quietly into their beds at night and only use the missionary position, which they endure but do not enjoy. Both are excited to have their first orgasms with the machine. Mrs. Daldry is content to continue having clinical treatments with the machine and suffer lifeless, boring sex with her own husband. "I am afraid there is very little sympathy between us." Catherine Givings wants more. First Mrs. Givings learns from a visiting artist that orgasms detached from love ultimately are unfulfilling and empty, simply surface, without soul, and similar to sex with prostitutes. Then a lower-class wet nurse, Elizabeth, reveals to Catherine that she may be able to enjoy the same sensations from the machine with her husband, with whom she is frustrated because of his clinical detachment, but still ultimately loves. Catherine first inspires jealousy and passion in her husband, then convinces Dr. Givings - who had earlier observed that "what men do not perceive because their intellect prevents them from seeing would fill a book" - to make naked snow angels with her and discovers the woman on top sex position, allowing her at last sexual satisfaction while the curtain lowers.
Staging.
The set is divided between two rooms, a parlor and a doctor's office. At the play's climax, the actors step through the imaginary wall dividing the rooms to create the third and final scene, outdoors in the falling snow.
Inspiration.
In the Director Presentation Les Waters states the play was inspired by "The Technology of Orgasm" by Rachel P. Maines. Ruhl cites Maines's book, as well as "AC/DC: The Savage Tale of the First Standards War" and "A Social History of Wet Nursing in America", as books she was reading when she chose to write the play.
Productions.
The play premiered at the Berkeley Repertory Theatre on February 5, 2009, under the direction of Les Waters. The Broadway production (presented by Lincoln Center Theater) began previews at the Lyceum Theatre on October 22, 2009 and officially opened on November 19.

She is a responsible, practical, and naturally independent woman who tries to install the same virtues in her daughters. Anne met George while she was majoring in Women's Studies at college. When Anne discovered she had become pregnant with Amy, she reluctantly dropped out of college, married George and became a housewife. Two years later, she had Ashley, and another 14 years after that, she had Robie. She and George separated after she became tired of his womanizing and realized that she was not happy in the marriage. She dated an architect for a while, and they planned to marry when she became pregnant, thinking it was his child; he later confessed that he could not have children, and she realized that Robie was George's son. She lived with her mother for a while after her separation from George, but when her mother went into a home for Alzheimer's patients, she was on her own, and began to see a high school sweetheart for companionship, but the relationship didn't go anywhere. She and George made an attempt to get back together and she took over the design portion of his furniture business, but again she finds poorly-hidden evidence that he was unfaithful, and resumed divorce proceedings. In season 5, after George spreads the truth as a rumor around town, Anne Juergens comes out to her family as a lesbian. She walks in her house one day when Nora (Ricky's birth mother) was having an AA meeting with all lesbians attending. Anne gets to know one of them closely and invited her to stay the night. They plan to go out on a date.
Leo Boykewich.
Steve Schirripa portrays Leo Boykewich, Ben's widowed father. He owns the local butcher shop, and is known as "The Sausage King". Leo is one of the first people to suspect Amy's pregnancy due to her huge appetite and nausea. He even supported Ben's decision to marrying Amy since he met Ben's mother when they were in high school. He's usually portrayed as the voice of reason for many of the characters on the shows. Such as when he tells Ben off for believing that he can support Amy's baby with his money. He gives Ben and Ricky jobs at the butcher shop as a way to help support Amy. In the second season, Leo begins to date a woman named Betty, who is the prostitute Tom had once hired. We later learn from Betty that she was very upfront about her profession the first day she introduced herself to Leo, because she was afraid of embarrassing him. He later proposes to Betty, but she explains that she may still be married to her ex. He promises to hunt down her husband, who turns out to be dead, and they get married in an elaborate ceremony. Leo takes Ricky under his wing by allowing him to live in the upstairs apartment. He is upset when Ben and Adrian discover they are having a baby, and tries to caution Ben from marrying Adrian just because she is pregnant. Ben is insistent, however, so Leo purchases a condo for the newlyweds. When Ben is ambivalent about being married, Leo sternly tells him that he made the choice, and he now has to make the best of it. When the baby is stillborn, Leo tearfully breaks the news to Ben and Adrian's friends at the hospital, and then later supports Ben's decision to get a divorce. In Season 4, Leo questions whether or not he wants to be married to Betty anymore when he suspects that his longtime assistant, Camille, is in love with him. Even so, Leo decides to stick with the marriage because he believes that is the right thing to do. Betty later decides that she wants a divorce and Leo agrees to it. He later sends Camille flowers and a bracelet and invites her out to dinner. While talking in the car on the way to dinner Camille kisses Leo, and the two are later seen together at graduation. They get married in the fifth season, and decide to take in a young girl who was the under-aged prostitute that Jack helped.

After Jack and Grace's relationship fizzles, Jack begins to date Madison. Madison, hoping to reassure Jack that she is a "free spirit" and doesn't want to trap him, tells Jack that she's not interested in children or marriage. This causes Jack to rethink the relationship because, as he tells her, the whole idea of dating is to find someone that you might want to marry. Since she says she doesn't want to marry, perhaps he should be dating elsewhere. Madison quickly recants and tells Jack that she is interested in a family and children, but not for a long time. They resume their relationship, and while Madison is seriously considering having sex with Jack, she confesses that she isn't quite ready, wanting the occasion to be special and wearing a pretty dress and having her make up done.

William Towers (rugby union)

William Hunter Towers (1861 – 7 July 1904) was an English-born rugby union forward who played club rugby for Swansea and county rugby for Durham. He was capped twice for Wales and was part of the Welsh team that faced the first overseas tourists, the New Zealand Natives.
Rugby career.
Towers originally played rugby for local club Hartlepool Rovers, and represented his county side, Durham. After moving to Wales, Towers switched to first-class Welsh team Swansea. It was while playing for Swansea that Towers was first selected to play for Wales in a game against Ireland as part of the 1887 Home Nations Championship. Towers was one of two new caps on the day, the other being Llanelli's John Goulstone Lewis. Under the captaincy of Tom Clapp, Wales beat the Irish team even though Ireland outscored Wales three tries to one; a peculiarity of the scoring system of the time.
In 1888 Towers, now captain of the Swansea senior team, gained his second and final international cap when he was chosen to face the touring New Zealand Natives. Although certain members of the Welsh team received a hostile reception from the St. Helen's crowd, Wales played well; with Towers scoring a try which Jim Webb converted. The Welsh managed another two tries without reply, for a memorable win. Two days later, on Christmas Eve, Towers faced the same New Zealand side as he led out the Swansea team against the tourists. In heavy rain, Swansea lost the match with the press criticising the Swansea players for complacency. During the same tour, Towers refereed the match between the New Zealand natives and Llanelli three days before the Welsh match, which Llanelli won thanks to a Harry Bowen dropped goal.

Tang dynasty in Inner Asia

Inner Asia in the 7th and, to a lesser degree, the 8th century AD, was marked by the expansion of the Tang dynasty's realm in the Tarim Basin, across the Gobi Desert and into Middle Asia. Wars were fought against the Gokturk Empires and Xueyantuo, but also against the states of the Tarim basin. This expansion was not steady; for example, the Tang did lose control of the Tarim basin temporarily to the Tibetans in the 680s, and their expansion north of the Gobi was thwarted in 682. Emperor Taizong's military success was, in part, a consequence of changes he initiated in the Chinese army, including improved weaponry. The emperor placed a new emphasis on cavalry, which was very important because his non-Chinese opponents used the horse effectively in warfare.
History.
Tang expansion.
The Tang dynasty was one of the Golden Ages of Chinese history. Coming out of the devastation of the late Sui, Tang emperors were eager to secure China's borders by defeating the Gokturks who were the primary military threat to North China. As a result, Tang forces mounted several campaigns against the Gokturks in order to neutralize them and secure China's borders in the process. Securing the Tarim Basin, which contained key trade routes, was also a secondary objective.
Tang conquest of the Eastern Gokturks.
The Eastern Gokturks were the primary threat to the Tang dynasty. Following Liang Shidu's defeat and death, the Tang dynasty prepared to march against the Eastern Gokturks. In 630, the Tang army marched against the Gokturks and defeated them in Southern Mongolia, sending them to flight. However, the real victory came when Li Jin, regarded as one of China's best generals, surprised the Eastern Gokturk Khan with a fast force of 3,000 Cavalry at the battle of Ying shan, which also involved a rear guard of over 100,000 Tang troops. This battle destroyed the Gokturk army, resulting in the capture of the Khan and over 120,000 Gokturks. Thus ended the Eastern Gokturk Empire. Emperor Taizong of Tang took up the title of Tian Kehan, or "Heavenly Khan" of the Gokturks.
Tang conquest of Xueyantuo.
Xueyantuo had helped Tang armies defeat the Eastern Gokturks, but after the demise of the Eastern Gokturks, Xueyantuo-Tang relations turned hostile because Xueyantuo kept on making attacks on Gokturks who were now Tang subjects.
In 642, Taizong sent an army to attack Xueyantuo and destroyed it.
Tang Conquest of the Western Gokturks.
The Western Gokturks were not an initial threat to the Tang, so initially relations were peaceful. However, Civil war and dispute in the Western Gokturks gave the Tang the opportunity to expand into Central Asia. From 642 to 645, the Tang army defeated the Western Gokturks and drove them out of Dzungaria.
In 657, the Tang defeated the last Western Gokturk Khan and took over all Western Gokturk territory.
The second Göktürk Kaghanate.
In what has been described as "a response to a surge of something like national sentiment", the Eastern Türkish Kaghanate was restored in 682 by Elterish (a.k.a. Qutlugh). In the Orkhon inscriptions, Elterish's son describes the modest beginnings of Elterish's struggle against the Tang thus: My father the kaghan set out with seventeen men, and as the word spread that he had set out and was advancing, those who were in the towns went up into the mountains and those who were in the mountains came down, they gathered, and there were seventy-seven men. Because heaven gave them strength, the army of my father was like wolves and his enemies were like sheep. [...] When they were seven hundred, in accordance with the institutions of my ancestors my father organized those who had been deprived of their state, those who had been deprived of their kaghan, who had become slaves and servants, who had lost their Türk institutions"
The new Kaghanate was centered on the upper Orkhon river and in the Ötükän, presumably the Khangai mountains. After decades of war and border raids with China, peace was made in 721–22. 
The second Gokturk Khanate remained a tributary and vassal of the Tang dynasty. It then survived until the 740s, when it fell due to internal conflicts and was succeeded by the Uighur Kaghanate
Retrenchment of Tang influence post-763.
In 755, the Tang dynasty was subject to the devastating Anshi Rebellion and lost much influence in Inner Asia, which came to be dominated by the Ughyurs. Tang influence and rule over the Northwestern regions, however, continued until the dynasty's fall in 907, at which time these areas were taken over by the Tanguts, who later established Xi Xia.
Tang-Ughyur relations.
Although they now controlled most of the Mongolian region, the Ughyur Khans still maintained relatively cordial relations with the Tang dynasty, accepting many titles from the Tang emperors. in 788, the Ughyur Khan pleaded the Tang emperor to change the title of the Ughyurs from Huihe (回紇) to Huihu (回鶻).
Fall of the Ughyur Khanate.
By the mid-800's, the power of the Ughyur Khanate was on the wane. Attacked on all sides, the Ughyurs retreated to the Xinjiang area and their Khanate collapsed, to be replaced by other peoples

Tibet during the Tang dynasty

Tibet during the Tang dynasty is an article on Tibet during the rule of the Tang dynasty. Chinese and Tibetan forces had many battles during this period.
In 763 AD, the Tibetans captured Chang'an in 763 during the midst of the Anshi Rebellion, which saw Tang China devastated by a massive Turkic uprising. However, the incursion was soon defeated.
The "Old Book of Tang" recorded the first ever embassy from Tibet arrived in China from Songtsän Gampo in the 8th Zhenguan year or 634 CE. Tang chronicles describe this as a tribute mission, but it brought an ultimatum demanding a marriage alliance, not subservient rituals. After this demand was refused, Tibet launched victorious military attacks against Tang affiliates in 637 and 638.
There is some confusion as to whether Central Tibet conquered Zhang Zhung during the reign of Songtsän Gampo or in the reign of Trisong Detsän, (r. 755 until 797 or 804 CE). The records of the "Tang Annals" do, however, seem to clearly place these events in the reign of Songtsän Gampo for they say that in 634, Yangtong (Zhang Zhung) and various Qiang tribes "altogether submitted to him." Following this he united with the country of Yangtong to defeat the 'Azha or Tuyuhun, and then conquered two more tribes of Qiang before threatening Songzhou with an army of (according to the Chinese) more than 200,000 men (100,000 according to Tibetan sources). He then sent an envoy with gifts of gold and silk to the Chinese emperor to ask for a Chinese princess in marriage and, when refused, attacked Songzhou. According to the "Tang Annals", he finally retreated and apologised and later the emperor granted his request,

Chandigarh Metro

Chandigarh Metro is a proposed rapid transit system for the city and union territory of Chandigarh in India.
History.
Delhi Metro Rail Corporation (DMRC) submitted the detailed project report of the Chandigarh Metro Project to Punjab Governor and UT administrator Shivraj Patil on 16 August 2012.
Motivation.
The main motivation for the setting up of Chandigarh Metro is that the population of Chandigarh Urban Complex (CUC) has been growing at a rate of over 5% per year in the last decade. There has also been a phenomenal growth in the number of vehicles in this period and their rising use due to rising household incomes since Chandigarh has the highest per capita income in the country. Beside this, there has been a sharp rise in the population of the nearby towns which has put a lot of pressure on the public transport system. In the absence of
adequate and quality mass transport system, people are using the personalised modes which is not only leading to congestion on road network but also increasing environmental pollution.
Road network is enough for now but main travel corridors are beginning to become congested. Travel speeds are declining on the major roads which have limited scope of widening. This indicates the need for judicious use of the available road space. Thus there is need to optimise the available capacity by adopting transport system management measures.
Many junctions particularly on Madhya Marg, Himalaya Marg, Dakshin Marg, Jan Marg, Purv Marg, Udyogpath etc. have very high traffic volumes and most of the junctions with rotaries have exceeded their capacity. With expected growth of traffic, the situation at these junctions is likely to deteriorate fast.
Parking is assuming critical dimensions in Chandigarh particularly in Sector 17. Parking facilities need to be augmented substantially. Hence there is a need for an alternative mode of transportation to reduce the congestion of parking spaces.
Plan.
In the first phase, a 37.573 km metro rail network will be built of which 23.468 km will be elevated and 14.105 km underground Corridor. It will run from north to south. It will start near Capitol Complex and will go up to Mohali. Corridor II, also known as East West Corridor, will start from Sector 21, Panchkula and reach up to Mullanpur.
Routes.
The proposed routes for the various corridors of the metro network are as follows:
Cost.
The project is expected to cost , out of which will be borne by Chandigarh Administration, will be borne by Punjab Govt. and the remaining by Haryana Govt. The expected cost of the metro elevated section is per Km and that of the metro underground section is per Km. The metro will be completed in two phases. The estimated cost of Phase-I is and that of Phase-II is .
Vision.
The vision behind the metro system is a well contained city with efficient people friendly transport system with minimum travel time & maximum safety and comfort. The main points of the envisaged vision are:

<doc id="21598145" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21598145" title="Blackburn C.A.15C">
Blackburn C.A.15C

The Blackburn C.A.15C Monoplane and Biplane were a pair of British aircraft intended to be as similar as possible apart from the wing arrangement. Tests in 1933 did not favour conclusively either design.
Development.
Though best known for military aircraft, Blackburn did investigate the commercial market. In particular they designed, but did not build, the C.A.15A (C.A. being Blackburn's designation for commercial aircraft), an 11-seat passenger tri-motor monoplane. This had the central engine mounted above and clear of the high wing, the other two engines suspended below the wings. Unusually, they intended to offer a biplane equivalent, an option made easy by the monoplane's wing engine configuration. They also investigated a slightly smaller version, the C.A.15B. These designs suggested to the Air Ministry that two otherwise identical aircraft could be built in monoplane and biplane versions to settle the constant dispute over which of these two configurations was the superior. Blackburn received a contract to build them.
The two C.A.15Cs were all-metal aircraft apart from the fabric-covered wings and tail surfaces. The fuselage, cabin and empennage were the same in both versions. The tailplane was braced and the fin and rudder rather angular and flat-topped, the rudder horn-balanced. Because the Air Ministry envisaged the aircraft going to Imperial Airways after the trials, the cabins were fully fitted out for 10 passengers, with two compartments containing six and four seats placed singly on either side of a central aisle. Warm air heating was fed from the engines. Between the enclosed cockpit for the two crew and the passenger cabins was a baggage compartment.
The wings were built in standard Blackburn fashion with steel spars and duralumin ribs. The biplane was of single-bay construction with equal-span, unstaggered wings. The upper wing was well clear of the fuselage. The monoplane had a high, braced wing. Total wing areas were similar, that of the monoplane some 3% greater. The desire to make the two aircraft as similar as possible somewhat penalised the monoplane because the divided undercarriage that fitted easily on the biplane's lower wing required some elaborate bracing on the monoplane.
The two versions used the same powerplants, a pair of 400 hp (300 kW) Armstrong Siddeley Jaguar IVC radials driving wooden two-blade propellers. They were, however, mounted differently, unlike the proposed C.A.15A and C.A.15B. The monoplane had engines embedded in the wings, while those in the biplane were mounted between the wings.
The biplane "G-ABKW" flew first on 10 June 1932 and the monoplane "G-ABKY" on 4 October 1932. The biplane turned out to be heavy to fly and with unreliable brakes making taxying difficult. Tailwheels were quite new at the time and the aircraft was troubled by shimmy. The monoplane posed fewer problems.
Operational history.
The two machines went to RAF Martlesham Heath in January 1933 for comparative trials. Despite the hopes, the trials were not conclusive. At the same all-up weight, the monoplane was faster and had a better rate of climb, but having an empty weight about 10% greater could not carry so great a payload.
The proposed post trial move to Imperial Airways did not happen for they were already re-equipping, so the biplane was immediately broken up. The monoplane did do useful service at the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough in the development of automatic pilots and in wireless experiments in RAF colours as "K4241". It then did a few months as an RAF taxi before being scrapped at the end of 1937.

Djiboutian presidential election, 2005

The 2005 Djiboutian presidential election took place on the 8 April 2005. The incumbent President of Djibouti, Ismail Omar Guelleh, was re-elected to a second six-year term in an unopposed election.
Background.
Hassan Gouled Aptidon was president of Djibouti from independence in 1977 until he stepped down in 1999. He had reintroduced multi-party democracy in 1992 under international pressure, but the 1999 presidential election saw Aptidon's nephew, Ismail Omar Guelleh, elected with 74% of the vote. The last parliamentary elections in 2003 saw Guelleh's political party, the Union for a Presidential Majority win all 65 seats in an election the opposition claimed saw significant rigging.
Campaign.
The main opposition parties in Djibouti did not put up a candidate in the presidential election and called on their supporters to boycott the election. The only opposition candidate who had said they would stand in the election was Mohamed Daoud Chehem. However on the 10 March 2005 he withdrew from the election as he said that he did not have enough money to take part in the election. A statement from one opposition party on the 18 March said that "change through the ballot box is almost impossible in the Republic of Djibouti".
Despite having no opponents President Guelleh campaigned strongly in the run up to the election. He held rallies in the evenings and pledged to reduce poverty, increase women's rights and improve the transparency of the government. He also accused the opposition of being afraid to stand against him and said that he regretted having no opponent in the election.
On the day of the election itself there was a protest against the election which was broken up by the police firing tear gas. The official news agency of Djibouti reported that there was a high turnout of over 70% of voters in the election, however members of the opposition said that this was incorrect.
Aftermath.
President Guelleh was sworn in as President for a second term on 9 May 2005 and pledged to increase economic development in Djibouti.

Invicta Ground

The Invicta Ground was a football stadium in Plumstead, south-east London, that was the home of Royal Arsenal (today known simply as Arsenal) between 1890 and 1893.
Named after "Invicta", the motto of the county of Kent (which was the county Plumstead was located in prior to 1889), the ground was Arsenal's first proper stadium, being equipped with a stand, a row of terracing and changing rooms. It stood on the south side of Plumstead High Street; Arsenal's old ground, the Manor Ground, on the opposite side of high street, was by contrast little more than a glorified pig field; the club had used military wagons as makeshift stands for spectators.
When Royal Arsenal first moved to the Invicta Ground, they were an amateur team with a following of only about 1,000, but within a year the club had turned professional and had renamed themselves Woolwich Arsenal. They started to attract much larger crowds, including a record 12,000 for a match against the then Scottish Cup holders Heart of Midlothian on 30 March 1891, which Woolwich Arsenal lost 5–1.
Woolwich Arsenal intended to use the Invicta for 1893–94, their first season playing in the Football League. However, the ground's owner, George Weaver (a mineral water magnate), wishing to make the most out of the rise in Arsenal's fortunes, put the annual rent up from £200 to £350, a sum which the club could not afford. Arsenal returned to the Manor Ground, which they bought outright after a share issue, and spent the summer of 1893 building proper stands and facilities.
An amateur side, Royal Ordnance Factories, set up in response to Woolwich Arsenal joining the League, played some home games in the Invicta Ground; however they had left by late 1894 and Weaver could not find a permanent tenant for the ground. He eventually demolished it, building houses on the site. Today Mineral Street and Hector Street stand where the stadium used to be; some of the stadium's concrete terracing still survives in the back gardens of houses in Hector Street.

Carola Richards

Carola Richards (1916–2004) was an English artist and member of the Eastbourne Group.
Life and work.
Born in Salford, Lancashire, Richards graduated with a degree in geology in 1938 and then qualified as a housing manager, in which profession she worked until 1973. Carola began painting in her early forties, eventually taking early retirement and moving to Brighton, East Sussex to pursue her new-found passion for art full-time. She then studied painting, drawing and printmaking under Hayward Veal (1913–1968), Peter Richmond, George W. Hooper (1910–1994) and John Hardy Meadows (b. 1912). She continued to study drawing and painting for the rest of her life, exploring a wide variety of approaches and media along the way.
Following early impressionistic work and a period of hard-edge abstraction, procuring influence of Avant-Garde art from the great war period; Cubism, Futurism and Vorticism, she progressed to a mature way of working resulting in a colourful exploration of figurative and imaginary subjects. As with Matisse, colour was Carola's primary interest and she achieved subtle and unusual relationships. Another side of her personality engendered strange images; colourful, whimsical, surreal, often bizarre; strange forms appeared as she worked over and over paintings going, as she said, in unforeseen directions and often surprising herself with the final results. She described the process of painting as 'frustrating, mysterious and exciting'.
In 1997 Carola generously donated two oil paintings by Dennis Creffield to the Brighton Museum & Art Gallery
Always curious about new ideas and processes, in her mid-eighties Richards decided to learn how to use a computer as a painting tool, and in 1999 her computer prints were exhibited in the Arundel exhibition. This exemplified her approach to life in general; she was always open to new ideas, excited by challenges and dogged in her pursuit of what she felt to be important. She never lost her childlike enthusiasm and her work reflected the freedom and imagination of an ever-young mind.
As a person Richards was extremely sociable, caring and thoughtful; always strongly emotionally involved in the lives of her many friends. She travelled widely and learned several languages, most notably Russian, which she continued to study with great dedication until her death in 2004.
Exhibitions.
Elected a member of the Eastbourne Group of artists in 1993, she exhibited widely, including at Brighton University 1975; University of Essex 1980; Tichbourne Studios, Brighton 1981; The London Group in 1982 & 1984; Towner Art Gallery, Eastbourne 1983; Royal College of Art, London 1984; Brighton Gallery of Fine Art 1987; Red Herring Gallery, Brighton 1989; Brighton Festival 1991; Albion Gallery, Lewes 1991 & 1992; Brighton Museum & Art Gallery 1995 & 1998; Arundel 1999, culminating in a large retrospective at the Towner Gallery, Eastbourne in 2006.

Joseph Dumont (April 19, 1847 – January 15, 1912) was a merchant and political figure in Quebec. He represented Kamouraska in the Legislative Assembly of Quebec from 1877 to 1878 and Kamouraska in the Canadian House of Commons from 1878 to 1882 as a Liberal member.
He was born in Saint-André, Quebec, the son of Lifsey Dumont and Émilie Saint-Pierre, and was educated at Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pocatière. In 1869, he was named a papal zouave at Rome. Dumont was a merchant at Kamouraska. He was elected to the provincial assembly in 1877 after Charles-François Roy was elected to the House of Commons; his election was overturned in March of the following year. Dumont was married twice: to Cléophile Paradis in 1874 and to Marie-Eugénie Gagnon in 1889. He lived in the United States from 1882 to 1887. On his return, he became archivist for the Secretariat of Quebec, serving until 1909, when he was named deputy secretary for the province. In the same year, he was named a knight in the Order of St. Gregory the Great. Dumont died in Quebec City at the age of 64.

TusCon

TusCon is a science fiction convention that has been held annually in Tucson, Arizona since 1974, making it the oldest continuous science fiction convention in the state of Arizona. It is currently presented every November by the Baja Arizona Science Fiction Association (BASFA), a 501(c)(4) not-for-profit corporation.
Notable guests.
TusCon has had a number of professional writers and artists as Guest of Honor in its history. Included are Evangeline Walton, Gordon Eklund, Theodore Sturgeon, Ed Bryant, Suzy McKee Charnas, George R.R. Martin, Elizabeth A. Lynn, Robert Bloch, Karl Edward Wagner, John Varley, Terry Carr, Tim Powers, Stephen R. Donaldson, David Brin, Dennis McKiernan, Laurell K. Hamilton, and many others.
In addition to the scheduled Guest of Honor, TusCon has had a reputation of having many professional writers, artists, and publishers attend the convention. Among those are Forrest J. Ackerman, Robert Asprin, Keith Henson, S. P. Somtow, David Schow, Dr. Edwin "Buzz" Aldrin, Simon Hawke, Liz Danforth, Judith Tarr, Patrick Nielsen Hayden, and others.
Activities.
In addition to the type of events that are prevalent at most conventions, TusCon has developed several different activities that have been adopted at other conventions. These include a Writers Workshop and contest held in conjunction with the Tucson-Pima Co. Municipal Library, An "adults-only" Midnight masquerade where costumes (or the lack thereof) tended to stretch societal norms, a "Furry Critter Stomp" where a dance floor was littered with a variety of nondescript plush beanbag "critters" and Congoers were invited to dance without concern for foot placement, a flintknapping seminar by Dr. Susan Gleason, and chili served to Convention members during the "Dead Dog Party" on the last day of the Con.

Grahame-White Ganymede

The Grahame-White Ganymede was a prototype British heavy night bomber intended to serve with the Royal Air Force in the First World War. A large, three-engined, twin-boom biplane, the sole prototype Ganymede did not fly until after the war had ended, and although an attempt was made to convert the aircraft to an airliner, it was unsuccessful.
Development and design.
In 1918, the Grahame-White Aviation Company of Hendon, London developed a large, long-range heavy bomber intended to equip the Royal Air Force. The resulting design, the E.IV Ganymede, was of unusual layout, being a three-engined, twin-boom biplane with four-bay wings. Two of the engines were located at the front of the booms, driving tractor propellers, while the third engine was installed at the rear of the central nacelle, driving a pusher propeller. A biplane tail unit with three fins and rudders spun the gap between the two main fuselage booms. The two pilots and a bomb-aimer/gunner were accommodated in the central nacelle, while additional gunners cockpits were provided in each of the fuselage booms, with Scarff ring mountings for a machine gun together with a tunnel opening under the fuselages to allow the gunners to repel attacks from below. 
It was intended that the Ganymede be powered by three 400 hp (298 kW) Liberty engine, but concerns about the availability of the American-built Liberty resulted in considerably less powerful Sunbeam Maori engines being specified when an order was placed for three prototypes. The first of these prototypes, serial number "C3481" was completed late in 1918. While it was tested by the Air Ministry during 1919, the RAF had little interest in purchasing a new heavy bomber, and the remaining two prototypes were cancelled.
After being damaged in a landing accident in 1919, Grahame-White rebuilt the Ganymede into a civil airliner, becoming the E.9 Ganymede. The central engine was removed completely, while the two remaining engines were replaced by 450 hp (336 kW) Napier Lions. The nacelle was rebuilt with two pilots in an open cockpit ahead of a glazed cabin housing 12 passengers. The modified aircraft was granted an Certificate of Airworthiness on 12 September 1919, with the Aircraft registration "G-EAMW", but was destroyed in a fire in September 1920.

LAMC3

Laminin subunit gamma-3 also known as LAMC3 is a protein that in humans is encoded by the "LAMC3" gene.
Function.
Laminins, a family of extracellular matrix glycoproteins, are the major noncollagenous constituent of basement membranes. They have been implicated in a wide variety of biological processes including cell adhesion, differentiation, migration, signaling, neurite outgrowth and metastasis. Laminins are composed of 3 non identical chains: laminin alpha, beta and gamma (formerly A, B1, and B2, respectively) and they form a cruciform structure consisting of 3 short arms, each formed by a different chain, and a long arm composed of all 3 chains. Each laminin chain is a multidomain protein encoded by a distinct gene. Several isoforms of each chain have been described. Different alpha, beta and gamma chain isomers combine to give rise to different heterotrimeric laminin isoforms which are designated by Arabic numerals in the order of their discovery, i.e. alpha1beta1gamma1 heterotrimer is laminin 1. 
The biological functions of the different chains and trimer molecules are largely unknown, but some of the chains have been shown to differ with respect to their tissue distribution, presumably reflecting diverse functions in vivo. This gene encodes the gamma chain isoform laminin, gamma 3. The gamma 3 chain is most similar to the gamma 1 chain, and contains all the 6 domains expected of the gamma chain. It is a component of laminin 12. The gamma 3 chain is broadly expressed in skin, heart, lung, and the reproductive tracts. In skin, it is seen within the basement membrane of the dermoepidermal junction at points of nerve penetration. However, it was also found that the gamma 3 is a prominent element of the apical surface of ciliated epithelial cells of lung, oviduct, epididymis, ductus deferens, and seminiferous tubules. The distribution of gamma 3-containing laminins along ciliated epithelial surfaces suggests that the apical laminins are important in the morphogenesis and structural stability of the ciliated processes of these cells.
A recent study found that LAMC3 plays a critical role in forming the convolution of the cerebral cortex. Particularly LAMC3 is expressed during the embryonic period, which contributes the formation of dentrites.

Kolkata LRTS

Kolkata Light Rail Transit System (LRTS) is a mass rapid transit system proposed for the city of Kolkata in India. The Government of West Bengal and SREI Infrastructure Finance signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) to set up the light rail transit (LRT) system. A special purpose vehicle, Kolkata Mass Rapid Transit Pvt Ltd has been formed to execute this Rs.6000 crore project.
History.
April 2002: The Master Plan for Kolkata Metropolitan Area (KMA) for 2025 was submitted for the approval by the Metropolitan Planning Committee. It was proposed to be executed soon after securing agreement from the chief minister Mr Buddhadeb Bhattacharjee. It was suggested in the feasibility report that it will work well as an intermediate system for some selected corridors. The search for funding started and it did not sound much in public.
2004: The Kolkata government wanted assistance from the central government which agreed to provide assistance for one major transit system project. Bhattacharjee chose LRTS over the East-West Metro corridor for the assistance and asked the state transport secretary to prepare a revised feasibility study. 
April 2005: The feasibility study by CES termed it as EMRTS (Elevated Mass Rapid Transit System) and proposed three corridors, all terminating at Esplanade. The rolling stock they proposed was high speed trams.
February 2009: The LRTS project was listed under JNNURM. It was to be jointly executed by SREI and the Czech-based AMEX Corporation on a Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) basis. It was also proposed to make the LRTS station at Barrackpore a terminal point connecting it with the main line station. Mr. Hemant Kanoria, Chairman and Managing Director of Srei Infrastructure Limited signed an MOU with the Government of West Bengal to execute this project along with their consortium partners.

Susan Clarencieux

Susan White known as Susan Clarencius (before 1510 – in or after 1564) was a favourite lady in waiting and longtime friend to Queen Mary I of England.
Family.
Susan White's family, the Whites of Hutton, were a cadet branch of the White family of South Warnborough, Hampshire.
According to Loades, Susan White was 'probably the youngest' of the four children of Richard White of Hutton, Essex and Maud Tyrrell, the daughter of Sir William Tyrrell of Heron, Essex. She had two sisters, Mary, who married firstly a husband surnamed Whitehead, and secondly a husband surnamed Spenser; and Joan, who married a husband surnamed Wilcocks; and a brother, Richard White, who married Margaret Strelley, the daughter of Nicholas Strelley of Strelley, Nottinghamshire, by whom he had a son, George White (d. 14 June 1584).
Life.
At some time before 1534 she married Thomas Tonge, who on 2 June 1534 became Clarenceux King of Arms. He died less than two years later, in March 1536, naming her his sole executor and leaving her the residue of his estate. Despite the brevity of his tenure as Clarenceux King of Arms, Susan was known as Susan Clarencius for the remainder of her life.
She joined Princess Mary's household as a maid in waiting when Mary was sent to the Welsh Marches as heiress presumptive. She lost her position when Mary's household was dissolved after her refusal to acknowledge Anne Boleyn as her father's wife; however she was reinstated after Mary's household was reinstated after she succumbed to pressure by her father's officials.
By June 1536 Mary considered her a trusted servant, and their close personal relationship lasted for the remainder of Mary's life. When Mary was considering marriage to Philip II of Spain in 1554, Clarenceux spoke in favour of the English candidate, Edward Courtenay, a distant relative of hers.
She survived her royal mistress. Following Queen Mary's death in 1558, she emigrated to Spain with another of Mary's former servants, Jane Dormer, the wife of Gomez Suarez de Figueroa of Cordova, 1st Duke of Feria, a friend of Philip of Spain. As there is no further mention of her in the records after the spring of 1564, she probably died about that time while a member of Feria's household.
Little else is known of her life. She may have been married in the three years of Mary's time at Hatfield. It is believed she had two children, to whom Mary was possibly godmother.

<doc id="21598766" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21598766" title="Side-by-side assembly">
Side-by-side assembly

Side-by-side technology is a standard for executable files in Windows 98 Second Edition, Windows 2000, and later versions of Windows that attempts to alleviate problems that arise from the use of dynamic-link libraries in Microsoft Windows. Such problems include version conflicts, missing DLLs, duplicate DLLs, and incorrect or missing registration. In side-by-side, Windows stores multiple versions of a DLL in the WinSXS subdirectory of the Windows directory, and loads them on demand. This reduces dependency problems for applications that include a side-by-side manifest.
Side-by-side technology is also known as WinSxS or SxS, although technically WinSxS refers only to the global side-by-side store (officially called the "Windows component store"), which is conceptually the native equivalent of the .NET Global Assembly Cache. Executables that include an SxS manifest are designated SxS assemblies.
Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 and 2008 employ SxS with all C runtime libraries. However, runtime libraries in Visual C++ 2010 no longer use this technology; instead, they include the version number of a DLL in its file name, which means that different versions of one DLL will technically be completely different DLLs now.
SxS is also the technological basis for registration-free COM activation. Only in-process COM servers may be activated this way.
Operation.
An application that employs SxS must have a "manifest". Manifests are typically a section embedded in the application's executable file but may also be an external file. When the operating system loads the application and detects the presence of a manifest, the operating system DLL loader is directed to the version of the DLL corresponding to that listed in the manifest. If there is no manifest, the DLL loader loads a default version of all DLL dependencies. If the DLL is a COM server, it must have a manifest of its own for registration-free activation to succeed.
On Windows Vista and later, application start failures due to SxS misconfiguration can be diagnosed using sxstrace.exe.
Because it is sometimes desirable to override manifest-specified assemblies anyway, for example in the case of security patches applied to a library, a publisher configuration file can globally redirect assemblies. Digital signatures may be used to ensure that this redirection is legitimate.
Manifest format.
The manifest is internally represented as XML. The URN associated with SxS manifests is "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:asm.v1".
Several other recent Microsoft technologies such as ClickOnce employ the same manifest format.
Example manifest.
The following is an example of a manifest for an application that depends on a C runtime DLL.
Activation contexts.
A manifest like the one above is parsed into an activation context by the SxS loader. There is a stack of activation contexts for each thread or fiber. An API allows programmatic manipulation of these contexts. It may be necessary for a library (DLL) to change its activation context, for example if it requires a specific version of another library for its own consumption instead of using the activation context of its caller. This type of issue is sometimes called (activation context) pollution. To prevent polluting its activation context, a DLL can have a manifest embedded as a resource, which is parsed when the DLL is loaded. This manifest must be at resource id 2 in the image file for the loader to find it.
WinSxS.
From Vista onward the operating system also uses WinSxS for its core components. Operating system files in the WinSxS directory are hard linked to their usual locations in the Windows directory structure. The same file may be linked from a directory in WinSxS and from, say, the System32 directory. Windows Explorer double counts the disk space occupied by these files. This can be demonstrated using the fsutil command-line program. (Some third-party Explorer extensions to show the link count also exist.) However not all files from WinSxS are projected this way to "live" operating system files. For example, after installing some Windows updates, old file versions replaced by the updates are still kept in WinSxS although they are no longer linked in the "live" Windows directories. This allows updates to be uninstalled safely.
Because of its elevated importance, from Vista onward the WinSxS directory is owned by the Trusted Installer service SID. By default not even administrators can modify its contents (without taking ownership first). Uninstalling applications does not immediately free space in the WinSxS directory; space for unused assemblies is garbage-collected over time by the Installer service.
Although not officially documented, the algorithm for generating the directory names residing inside the WinSxS directory has been made public on an MSDN Microsoft employee's blog. The algorithm was changed in the transition from XP to Vista.
Misconceptions.
The winsxs directory is thought to be much larger than it actually is. The directory contains mostly "hard links" to files that exist elsewhere. DIR and Explorer are not aware of the difference between an actual file and a hard link to a file, and so may count the same file several times, adding incorrectly to the perceived disk usage. The disk usage reported by these two programs is as if each hard link is an actual file.

Bald cap

A bald cap is a wig-like cap simulating the appearance of a bald or partially bald head. As part of an actor's make-up, it is often used to make a person appear older. Bald caps are a versatile medium. They form the basis of many creative fantasy make-ups.
Bald caps may be purchased ready-made or be constructed on-site by a make-up artist, who applies several layers of liquid plastic (such as latex) to a pattern made by covering the actor's head in clingfilm. The finished cap is glued to the actor's head with spirit gum or surgical adhesive, and the edges of the cap are blended with the actor's skin using make-up techniques. Almost any colour medium can be applied to the bald cap to give it colour and texture for creating a bald look, to blending in with skin tones.
Bald caps used in the theatre are made of thicker rubber, intended to be put on and off rapidly and multiple times. Coarser and more unrealistic bald caps are sometimes also used as part of a clown costume. They may also be made of plastic.
Bald caps may also be used for occasions when an actor who has hair wishes to act as if they are wearing a wig to cover up their baldness. In this case, the actor will wear a bald cap with a wig on top; the wig can be removed to reveal the "baldness" beneath. This trick received notable use in the "Earthanasia" episode of the British comedy program, "The Goodies".

He was the Norwegian ambassador in Chile from 1975 to 1982, ambassador to the Caribbean from 1982 to 1987, in Venezuela from 1987 to 1988 and again in Chile from 1988 to 1992. He retired in 1992.
1973 Chilean coup d'état.
Bergens Tidende has said that Norway sent him to Chile "on a special mission. He was to open the embassy for persecuted asylum seekers—and reestablish Norway's honour." (Norway's then honorary general consul had made controversial statements in support of Pinochet's government, and then ambassador had made a controversial statement about the coup d'état.) 
Norway sent him to Chile "right after the coup d'état, and he quickly had space cleared for 30 refugees on the embassy's second floor".

Neighbourhood components analysis

Neighbourhood components analysis is an unsupervised learning method for classification multivariate data into distinct classes according to a given distance metric over the data. Functionally, it serves the same purposes as the K-nearest neighbors algorithm, and makes direct use of a related concept termed "stochastic nearest neighbours".
Definition.
Neighbourhood components analysis aims at "learning" a distance metric by finding a linear transformation of input data such that the average leave-one-out (LOO) classification performance is maximized in the transformed space. The key insight to the algorithm is that a matrix formula_1 corresponding to the transformation can be found by defining a differentiable objective function for formula_1, followed by use of an iterative solver such as conjugate gradient descent. One of the benefits of this algorithm is that the number of classes formula_3 can be determined as a function of formula_1, up to a scalar constant. This use of the algorithm therefore addresses the issue of model selection.
Explanation.
In order to define formula_1, we define an objective function describing classification accuracy in the transformed space and try to determine formula_6 such that this objective function is maximized.
formula_7
Leave-one-out (LOO) classification.
Consider predicting the class label of a single data point by consensus of its formula_3-nearest neighbours with a given distance metric. This is known as "leave-one-out" classification. However, the set of nearest-neighbours formula_9 can be quite different after passing all the points through a linear transformation. Specifically, the set of neighbours for a point can undergo discrete changes in response to smooth changes in the elements of formula_1, implying that any objective function formula_11 based on the neighbours of a point will be "piecewise-constant", and hence "not differentiable".
Solution.
We can resolve this difficulty by using an approach inspired by stochastic gradient descent. Rather than considering the formula_3-nearest neighbours at each transformed point in LOO-classification, we'll consider the entire transformed data set as "stochastic nearest neighbours". We define these using a softmax function of the squared Euclidean distance between a given LOO-classification point and each other point in the transformed space:
formula_13
The probability of correctly classifying data point formula_14 is the probability of classifying the points of each of its neighbours formula_9:
formula_16 where formula_17 is the probability of classifying neighbour formula_18 of point formula_14.
Define the objective function using LOO classification, this time using the entire data set as stochastic nearest neighbours:
formula_20
Note that under stochastic nearest neighbours, the consensus class for a single point formula_14 is the expected value of a point's class in the limit of an infinite number of samples drawn from the distribution over its neighbours formula_22 i.e.: formula_23. Thus the predicted class is an affine combination of the classes of every other point, weighted by the softmax function for each formula_24 where formula_25 is now the entire transformed data set. 
This choice of objective function is preferable as it is differentiable with respect to formula_1:
formula_27
formula_28
Obtaining a gradient for formula_1 means that it can be found with an iterative solver such as conjugate gradient descent. Note that in practice, most of the innermost terms of the gradient evaluate to insignificant contributions due to the rapidly diminishing contribution of distant points from the point of interest. This means that the inner sum of the gradient can be truncated, resulting in reasonable computation times even for large data sets.
Alternative formulation.
"Maximizing formula_11 is equivalent to minimizing the formula_31-distance between the predicted class distribution and the true class distribution (ie: where the formula_32 induced by formula_1 are all equal to 1). A natural alternative is the KL-divergence, which induces the following objective function and gradient:" (Goldberger 2005)
formula_34
formula_35
In practice, optimization of formula_1 using this function tends to give similar performance results as with the original.
History and background.
Neighbourhood components analysis was developed by Jacob Goldberger, Sam Roweis, Ruslan Salakhudinov, and Geoff Hinton at the University of Toronto's department of computer science in 2004.

Soul Underground

Soul Underground was a UK-based music magazine covering ‘underground’ black music and dance music, which launched in 1987 and ceased publication in January 1991.
The magazine was conceived as a reaction to what co-founders Darren Reynolds and David Lubich saw as the failure of the mainstream music press to cover the growth of an underground dance music scene in the UK. This went beyond the music itself to the fashions, warehouse parties and subcultures that were finding their feet at the time. 
From the outset, Soul Underground sought to cover a wide range of music – from the burgeoning ‘Rare Groove’ scene of the late 80s, though rap, electro, house to reggae and soul. It quickly gained a reputation for its provocative features and news reports, and its interest in writing about music from a historical and even political perspective.
Its perceived credibility amongst musicians, club and radio DJs and journalists meant that it was able to attract a very strong team of writers and photographers.
The magazine was founded as a fanzine: its first issue had a print run of just 850 copies, and was distributed through record shops. Sales grew quickly, leading to a disagreement between Reynolds and Lubich over the direction the magazine should take (Darren wanted to preserve its ‘fanzine’ ethos, while David believed that it could evolve into a 'proper' magazine without compromising its independence and credibility). Darren left the magazine at issue 7, leaving David as publisher and editor.
As dance music made the move from underground ‘scene’ to huge commercial success, Soul Underground saw its sales and profile rise. National newsagent distribution followed in late ’89, as did limited distribution through record and clothing stores in New York.
In early 1990, Soul Underground gained a presence in New York – both in terms of sales and editorial coverage. It appointed as New York editor Leonard Abrams, former editor of the "East Village Eye", who built a roster of writers and photographers and helped the magazine stay on top of the city's burgeoning hip-hop scene
Notable firsts.
Soul Underground's network of music and culture obsessives gave it an edge in reporting on a number of hugely influential developments. It was the first magazine to cover the 'Bristol Scene', ran the first major interview with A Guy Called Gerald and championed the emergence of a new generation of black comedians including Angie Le Mar.
A career launchpad.
Although Soul Underground employed a number of established journalists, it gained a reputation for its ‘open door’ policy and for an ability to spot and nurture talent. A passion for music was more important than formal journalistic skills. 
In this way, the magazine proved to be something of a career launch pad. Some of the writers, artists, photographers and DJs associated with the magazine stayed within the media, while others moved into music and fashion
Although critically successful and intermittently profitable, Soul Underground was undercapitalized and unable to cope financially with the sudden drop in ad revenue that occurred around the end of 1990. Unable to secure financial backing, Lubich was forced to close Soul Underground in January 1991
Anthology: "Catch The Beat".
An anthology "Catch the Beat: The best of Soul Underground 1987-91" was published by Djhistory.com in October 2010. The hardcover, 440-page book contains a selection of features, interviews, charts and news stories from each of Soul Underground's 38 issues. Catch The Beat has received overwhelmingly positive reviews from music magazines including Mojo and Record Collector, and from DJs including Greg Wilson, who has written about it at his blog.

Rumble the Bison is the official mascot of the Oklahoma City Thunder. He is an anthropomorphic bison and his name derives from the sound that thunder makes. Rumble debuted on February 12, 2009 as part of the halftime show when the Thunder played against the New Orleans Hornets.
On August 13, 2009, Rumble was awarded the NBA Mascot of the Year award at the NBA's annual mascot meeting in Las Vegas. Rumble received the award in recognition of representing the Thunder at various community events throughout the Oklahoma City region. Even though he had only served as the team's official mascot for six months at the time, the mascot program Rumble developed was regarded as one of the best in the NBA.Rumble is a very popular mascot on account of his interaction with fans. He constantly gives hugs, high fives, and t-shirts to fans at random.
Official Backstory.
According to his official backstory on NBA.com, Rumble is the subject of a Native American tale that has been passed down for centuries which tells of a bison who was struck by lightning while saving his herd from a ferocious storm in the Arbuckle Mountains. The lightning transformed him into the anthropomorphic, super-powered bison known today as Rumble. When the Thunder arrived in Oklahoma City, he identified with them and joined the team.

The Faithful Spy

The Faithful Spy is a novel by "New York Times" reporter Alex Berenson. The novel won an Edgar award for Best First novel. It was published in 2006 by Random House and deals with the September 11th terrorist attacks.
Plot.
The book begins a few months after the September 11th terrorist attacks on the United States, with John Wells, an undercover CIA agent, in the middle of a battle in Afghanistan. Wells has been undercover with Al Qaeda for many years, fighting in Chechnya, Afghanistan and Pakistan. During the battle he and his crew of Al-Qaeda members are on a hillside where a group of United States Marines are stationed. The small Al-Qaeda band is planning to attack the Marines to help with a bigger battle that is raging below, and Wells decides to take out the terrorists himself so he can send a message to his CIA contact via the Marines: "No prior knowledge of 9/11. Say hi to Heather for me."
Meanwhile, back in the United States, Jennifer Exley, his CIA handler, visits a prisoner of war being held on a Navy ship to try to get information on Wells, who has been incommunicado for two years.
Al Qaeda detonates two truck bombs in LA, killing hundreds of people. John Wells is returned to the USA on a mission from Al Qaeda where he reconnects with the CIA. However due to the length of his absence he is accused of being “un-faithful” because he did not warn the US about Al Qaeda attacks. The accuser, Vinny Duto forces John to take a polygraph test. He proves himself to be innocent. Wells is put in a CIA safe house in Washington, DC but escapes in order to continue his Al Qaeda mission.
He heads to Atlanta and spends several months hiding out before being given the task of killing a retired US Army general. After completing this task, and secretly killing his two fellow Al Qaeda members, he is given the task of collecting something from Canada. While in Canada, he meets with an Al-Qaeda member to collect a suitcase, really a scientist who has been working to grow the plague bacteria. Wells returns with the suitcase but has secretly been infected with the plague by the scientist. Wells then learns that Al Qaeda used the LA bombings as a distraction from an impending, much larger attack; several other Al Qaeda members have infected themselves with the plague and plan to spread it throughout the population, creating a pandemic within the United States. Wells, with the help of Exley, is able to kill the infected terrorists and take out their leader, Khadri, thwarting their plans.

Linha do Norte is the Portuguese main railway track that connects the two main Portuguese cities, Lisbon and Porto. In its 314 km, it crosses some other important cities like Vila Franca de Xira, Santarém, Entroncamento, Pombal, Coimbra, Aveiro, Espinho e Vila Nova de Gaia, among others. It's the backbone of the Portuguese railway system of freights and passengers, running daily hundreds of wagons of both types.
Soon it'll have a parallel high-speed line (up to 300 km/h) to relieve this main line, since it has reached a saturation threshold where it's impossible to add new freight wagons without jamming the fast passenger services (InterCidades and Alfa Pendular).

The Sea-Bell

"The Sea-Bell" or "Frodos Dreme" is a poem by J.R.R. Tolkien included in his 1962 collection of verse "The Adventures of Tom Bombadil".
Background.
The work is based on an earlier poem entitled "Looney", which Tolkien had published in "The Oxford Magazine" in 1934. The 1962 version of the poem is considerably darker than, and twice as long as, the earlier version. Tolkien was initially reluctant to include the work in the collection, feeling that it was out of keeping with the other poems.
Although "Looney" was composed long before Tolkien began work on "The Lord of the Rings", the 1962 version is subtitled "Frodos Dreme". Tolkien's mock-academic introduction to the collection suggests that, although the poem may not have been composed by Frodo Baggins, it was associated with him by its readers and reflects the dark dreams that plagued him in his final days in the Shire.
The narrative.
The poem is a first person narrative by a speaker who is never identified in the main body of the poem. The rhyme scheme and metre are highly elaborate. 
"The Sea-Bell" opens with the speaker coming across a white shell "like a sea-bell" as he walks by the shore. He hears the sound of distant harbours and seas as he holds the shell in his hand. Suddenly a boat appears and he is borne away "to a forgotten strand in a strange land./ In the twilight beyond the deep". 
The land he arrives in is glittering, beautiful and mysterious. He hears the sound of distant music, voices and footfalls, but when he seeks the source of the sound the mysterious inhabitants of the land flee from him. Climbing onto a mound he presumptuously names himself king of the land, and challenges its people to come forth. Darkness descends upon him and he falls to the ground, blinded and bent. For a year and a day afterwards he dwells in the wood "wandering in wit" and growing grey and old. 
Eventually, broken and weary, he seeks out the sea and boards a ship that will take him back to his own land. However, when he arrives home the sea-bell no longer carries sounds from over the sea to him.The poem ends on a note of anguish as the speaker finds himself alienated from his own world, misunderstood and forsaken by those he once knew. The final image is of the narrator walking along a dark, rainy street talking to himself "for still they speak not, men that I meet".
Themes and Reception.
The poem touches on many themes which are recurrent in Tolkien's work: mortality, the otherworld, alienation, desire, suffering, pride, the sea and nature. It has been suggested that the poem which follows it in "The Adventures of Tom Bombadil", "The Last Ship", is a companion piece. Verlyn Flieger has argued that the association of "The Sea-Bell" with Frodo gives the poem considerably more depth than it had in its 1934 recension and adds much to our understanding of the central character of "The Lord of the Rings". W. H. Auden considered it Tolkien's best poetic work.

The Ghost War is the second John Wells thriller by "The New York Times" writer, Alex Berenson.
In "The Faithful Spy", John Wells became the only American CIA agent ever to penetrate al-Qaeda, but his handlers became distrustful of him, and he of them. He had to stop a devastating terrorist attack nearly alone.
Now Wells is back in Washington, D.C.. His wounds have healed, but his mind is far from clear. He is restless, uneasy in his skin, and careless with his safety. When the CIA finds evidence of a surge in Taliban activity, backed by an unknown foreign power, it takes little to convince Wells to return to Afghanistan to investigate. But what he discovers there is far from what he expected.

Lake Island

Lake Island is an island on the coast of the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is located between Mathieson Channel and Lady Trutch Passage, and is flanked by Dowager Island (to the northwest), Lady Douglas Island (to the west), and a long finger shaped peninsula of the Canadian mainland to the east. Ironically, Lake Island is not a lake island, as it is in an inlet of the Pacific Ocean, and lies only some 6 kilometres from the open sea.
Lake Island is part of a volcanic area called the Milbanke Sound Group and includes monogenetic cinder cones. Basaltic tuff breccias on Lake Island originated from Helmet Peak.

Four-State Tornado Swarm

The Four-State Tornado Swarm was a destructive outbreak of tornadoes in New England on August 15, 1787. At least five separate tornadoes caused major damage in the states of Connecticut, Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and New Hampshire. Two people were killed by a tornado in Wethersfield, Connecticut, and many were injured throughout New England. This event is considered to be the first true tornado outbreak on record.
__TOC__
Synopsis.
The first storm damage occurred in Litchfield, Connecticut, where a strong northwest wind and hail stones weighing more than damaged crops and broke windows. Four men were struck by lightning, but survived.
The first tornado touched down near New Britain, Connecticut, between 1 pm and 2 pm, moving east-northeast. A barn roof was blown away. The tornado then passed through Newington on its way to Wethersfield. The tornado there was described as " with amazing velocity and a most tremendous roar." It passed through a mostly-uninhabited part of the town; if the path were more than further north or south, the tornado "would have been fatal to a large number of families." The tornado traveled slightly north of east, and struck just one home. The inhabitants fled the house upon the sight of the tornado: two young boys, a laborer, and a mother and baby were overtaken by the tornado in a nearby field. The two boys were found amid some rubble, one dead and one was "feared mortally wounded." The mother was killed as well, but the baby who was in her arms survived with only minor injuries. The laborer was thrown over a fence but only slightly injured. Their house was unroofed, and several outbuildings were "leveled with the ground". Clothes from the house were found three miles away, and trees and boards were carried or more.
The tornado continued east-northeast from Wethersfield, leveling almost all trees in its path, until it reached Glastonbury. There it damaged several homes and barns, including an unroofing of a large brick home, but only injured two people slightly. The damage continued into at least Bolton and Coventry, where more damage was done, but any specific damage done or human casualties are unknown.
The second tornado was spotted west of East Windsor. It moved northeast away from the center of town, but did damage to a home and a barn. Trees in diameter were twisted down, and even sod and stones "of a considerable size" were torn up. No injuries were reported, however.
The third tornado of the outbreak was a long-tracked tornado, first spotted in Killingly, Connecticut. It moved northeast into Rhode Island to near Glocester. Orchards were destroyed there, and a house and barn were "torn to pieces" while the family took shelter in the cellar. Several other homes were unroofed, and a woman was carried some distance, but only suffered minor injuries. The tornado continued northeast into Massachusetts as far as Mendon, from where it touched down.
The fourth known tornado was first spotted near Northborough, Massachusetts. The tornado caused more severe damage along the border between Marlborough and Southborough. In Marlborough, a barn was thrown from its foundation. A house's roof was destroyed, with pieces scattered away. In Southborough and Framingham, many structures were damaged. A house in Framingham was destroyed while two women were inside, but they suffered only bruises. The tornado dissipated east of Framingham. Many crops were destroyed by winds and floods.
Observers reported seeing pieces of buildings, furniture, and trees thrown about in the air. Severe tree damage was reported all along the tornado's path. Along the tornado's route, the damage was not more than wide, and in some places was much narrower, though the damage was greatest in these areas.
The final tornado of the day occurred much further north in the town of Rochester, New Hampshire. A house was lifted from its foundation with eight people inside, but only two were injured. Pieces of the house were found distant. A barn was "taken and entirely carried off" by the tornado, and was not found. Trees, fences, and crops were leveled along the tornado's path, which was around wide. Considerable damage also occurred in Dunbarton, New Hampshire and Concord, New Hampshire, but it is not known if this was not directly connected to the tornado.
Historical perspective.
This day was the most extensive tornado event on record at the time, and was the most severe tornado outbreak in early New England history, on par only with the 1821 Great New Hampshire tornado outbreak. Very few buildings were struck by the tornadoes (though the tornadoes passed close to many highly populated towns) which accounts for the low death toll. However, the destructive potential was high, as indicated by the incredible tree damage in places.
A document was published in the "Connecticut Courant" (now the "Hartford Courant") a few days later, detailing the appearance of "a black column from the earth to the cloud" near Wethersfield. This was the most complete description of a tornado on record until the 1830s.

Manuel Buíça

Manuel dos Reis da Silva Buíça (30 December 1876 — 1 February 1908) was a Portuguese schoolteacher, former cavalry Sergeant, and excellent marksman involved with Alfredo Costa in the regicide of King Carlos I of Portugal and the Prince Royal, Luis Filipe, during the events that became known as the 1908 Lisbon Regicide (on February 1, 1908).
Biography.
Son of reverend Abílio da Silva Buíça, parish priest of Vinhais, and Maria Barroso.
Buíça married twice: the first lasted from 1896 to 1898, and his second, to Hermínia Augusta da Costa, with whom he had two children (Elvira and Manuel). 
Manuel Buíça had few friends, outside his professional acquaintances, although he was a close colleague of Alfredo Costa and Aquilino Ribeiro (the latter of whom he referred to in his last testament by name), with whom he mingled at the Café Gelo in the Rossio.
His professional career started with his conscription into the army, where he would achieve the status of second Sergeant, and hold the title of field instructor in shooting, while at the Cavalry Regiment in Bragança. A professional, Buíça also enrolled in the master-at-arms training course, obtaining a medal for first class sharpshooting medallion in the process. Unfortunately, his career in the military was not spotless: there were various infractions and three disciplinary notes in his record.
After the army, Buíça enrolled in courses at the Colégio Nacional, and participated in lessons in music and French.
Elevator coup.
On the night of January 28, 1908 several men were arrested by the police around the Lisbon Municipal Library Elevator. This group of people were later determined to be the principal revolutionaries in an attempted republican coup that was to have effectively occurred on January 28, 1908, but failed. The "Janeirada" (which colloquially means the "January thing"), or more commonly referred to as the Municipal Library Elevator Coup, was an attempted coup to assassinate João Franco, proclaim a republic and abolish the monarchy (by this, its King, Carlos I of Portugal).
A cell of 20 men, led by Alfredo Costa, that also included Manuel Buíça, originally were to assault the Royal Palace, but later, strategically modified their assault to the Quartel dos Lóios, and attacked contingents of the Municipal Guard, around the "Rua de Santa Bárbara", until they received word of the "revolution" (from a particular mortar explosion.
The "Janeirada" was planned by members of the Portuguese Republican Party, their enforcers, the Formiga Branca, elements of the Progressive Dissidency Party and the Carbonária, the latter two providing financing, men and arms. In addition to António José de Almeida, there was support from the shadows from Luz de Almeida, the chief of the Carbonária Lusitana, Machado Santos and António Maria da Silva. The decision to murder the King, was not clear, but these instructions were passed on to Alfredo Costa's group, as part of the coup plans. But, the plans were shelved immediately when, tipped-off by police, João Franco's government began rounding-up the "usual suspects" in militant republican circles. Those that could escape, did so, while others congregated around São Julião's Elevator and were rounded-up by the police on mass. In fact, the limits were limited to the higher-echelon members and leaders of the anti-monarchist movement, while lower level dissidents and thugs were limited to attacks in the Rato, in Alcântara, in the Campo de Santana, and along the "Rua da Escola Politécnica" (where one officer was killed).
The back room of the Café Gelo, then a popular meeting place for republican and Carbonária sympathizers, was empty in the following days, except for Manuel Buíça and Alfredo Costa who had escaped the sweep and were not afraid to be seen.
Assassination.
On the morning of February 1, 1908, Manuel Buíça met with Alfredo Costa and other Carbonária in Quinta do Xexé, in Olivais, where they finalized the regicide of King Carlos I of Portugal. Around two in the afternoon, Buíça has lunch with Costa and three other conspirators in the corner of the Café Gelo. Near the kitchen, the nook allowed members to converse unnoticed. At the end of their conversations, Buíça was the first to get up, and mention to the other two he was going to ""get the wand"", which likely referred to his Winchester series 2137 carbine rifle, which had been imported from Germany by Heitor Ferreira.
By four in the afternoon, Manuel Buíça, Domingos Ribeiro and José Maria Nunes, positioned themselves in the Terreiro do Paço, near the statute of D. José and near a tree in front of the Ministry of the Kingdom, alongside a kiosk. Alfredo Costa, Fabrício de Lemos and Ximenes assume positions below the arcade of the Ministry, and mingled with the population gathered for the King's arrival by boat.
At about 5:20, as the landau rounded the square, Manuel Buíça advanced from his position, and from 8–10 meters behind the carriage, he dropped to one knee and fired the first shot. His aim was perfect: the bullet hit the monarch in the neck, immediately snapping his spine at his neck, and effectively killed Carlos I. His second shot only guaranteed the King's death, but may have been directed to the young Prince Royal seated in front of the King. This second shot clipped that amplets on the left shoulder of the King, and caused the king to slump to the right. At this time Alfredo Costa intervenes, jumping on the landau and firing two shots into the back of the King. Buíça moved his position, and fired on the Prince Royal, as the latter was confronting Costa: the first projectile misses, but the second hits Luís Philip in the face (exiting the cranium) killing the Prince.
But Buiça was not finished, and attempted to move position for another volley, when he was interrupted by Henrique da Silva Valente, a soldier of the 12th Infantry, who was in the square. In their brief confrontation, the soldier is hit in the leg. By then a cavalry officer, Lieutenant Francisco Figueira fired on Buíça, hitting him in the leg, and as the assassin attempted to flee, Figueira immobilizes him with a shot that hit his thigh. A police officer finally kills Buíça in the square.
Afterward.
Manuel Buíça, 31 years old, was buried on February 11, 1908; three men, members of the Associação do Registo Civil (English: "Association of the Civil Registry") had protested outside the morgue, in order to convince the director to allow them to have a civil funeral.
Earlier that day, the autopsy found: a contusion at the top of the cranium, a laceration in his lower back (likely caused by Lieutenant Figueiro's sabre) and a wound to the left breast. This wound was the fatal entry, the bullet clipped the heart and perforated the liver. The recovered bullet was a 6.35 caliber bullet from an automatic pistol, a munition that was not used by the Portuguese police at the time, fueling speculation that some extra-military personnel had finally killed the assassin.
In the afternoon, his cadaver, along with Alfredo Costa and the body of an innocent bystander (José Sabino), were gathered by sent to the cemetery in the Alto de São João. The two assassins' bodies were buried in graves 6044 and 6045, but in 1914, they were exhumed and placed in the local mausoleum. Shortly after their burial, permission was given by the "acclamation" government of Ferreira do Amaral to allow republican sympathizers to visit the graves. These events were organized by the Associação do Registo Civil, which furnished flowers and paid (500 réis per person and 200 réis per child) for those that appeared at the graves. After the 5 October Revolution ushered in a republican government, the Associação do Registo Civil acquired a plot in the cemetery and erected a monument to ""the heroic liberators of the Fatherland"". The monument was eventually dismantled during the Estado Novo, but its elements were never destroyed, but preserved and never replaced.
Around six-months before the regicide of King Carlos and Prince Luis Philip, Manuel Buíça had become a widower, and his children, ages seven and four years, would be left with their maternal grandmother.
There is a belief, primarily in republican circles, that Buíça was an idealist, whose assassination of the King and Prince Royal, were accomplished as a form of justice and honourable duty for the Fatherland. In his final will, dated January 28, 1908, four days before the Lisbon Regicide, he wrote the following:
""Manuel dos Reis da Silva Buiça, widower, son of Augusto da Silva Buiça and Maria Barroso, resident of Vinhais, concelho of Vinhais, district of Bragança. I am a native of Bouçoais, concelho of Valpaços, district of Vila Real (Traz-os-Montes), married D. Herminia Augusta da Silva Buíça, daughter of a retired major in the cavalry and D. Maria de Jesus Costa. The major was João Augusto da Costa, widower. My wife left me two children, that I know: Elvira, who was born on 19 December 1900, in "Rua de Santa Marta", bottom floor, and who is not yet baptised nor civilly registered and Manuel who was born on 12 September 1907 in Escadinhas da Mouraria, No.4, fourth floor and was registered in the administration of the first barrio of Lisbon, on 11 October, in the year above referred."
"The witnesses were Albano José Correia, married, employed in commerce and Aquilino Ribeiro, single, publicist. Both my children live with me and their maternal grandmother in Escadinhas da Mouraria, No.4, 4th floor, left."
"My family lives in Vinhaes, where it is likely my death or disappearance, should that be. My children will remain poor; I have nothing to leave them, except my name and my respect and compassion for those who suffer. I plead that they be educated in the principals of liberty, equality and fraternity...and for whom they remain, through providence, in short, orphans."
"Lisbon, 28 January 1908. Manuel dos Reis da Silva Buiça. Remember my signature, Rua do Crucifixio, Lisbon."

Parasoft (officially Parasoft Corporation) is an independent software vendor with headquarters in Monrovia, California. It was founded in 1987 by five graduates of the California Institute of Technology who had been working on Caltech Cosmic Cube.
The most recent awards received were the Jolt Grand Prize Award for Parasoft Virtualize, Parasoft's service virtualization technology and the Embeddy Award for most cutting edge product for embedded software developers & engineers. Parasoft joined the Eclipse Consortium board of stewards in 2002.
Technologies.
Parasoft develops automated defect prevention technologies that support the Automated Defect Prevention methodology developed by Adam Kolawa. These technologies automate a number of defect prevention practices for Java, C and C++, and .NET. The static code analysis practice identifies coding issues that lead to security, reliability, performance, and maintainability issues later on. In 1996, Parasoft submitted a patent application for their rule-based static code analysis. Since then, the original static analysis technology has been extended to include security static analysis, data flow analysis, and software metrics. In 1996, Parasoft submitted patent applications for technology that automatically generates unit test cases. Since then, the original unit testing technology has been extended to include code coverage analysis, regression testing, and traceability. The peer code review practice involves manually inspecting source code to examine algorithms, review design, and search for subtle errors that automated tools cannot detect. Although the peer inspection itself cannot be automated, peer code reviews preparation, notification, and tracking can be automated.
For cloud, SOA, APIs, and enterprise IT environments, Parasoft technologies automate practices such as integration testing, system testing, load testing, and penetration testing. Parasoft's service and SOA quality technology was first developed in 2002.
Parasoft also develops memory error detection technology that finds run-time errors in C and C++ programs.
Patents were submitted for this technology in 1995 and 1996.
For service virtualization, Parasoft technologies are used to automatically capture and emulate dependent system behavior of mainframes, third-party components, or any system component that is unavailable or difficult to access for development and testing purposes.

Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Pittsburgh Branch

The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland Pittsburgh Branch Office is one of the three Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland branch offices. The Pittsburgh Office of the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland hosts one of two savings bonds processing sites in the nation. The current chairman is Sunil T. Wadhwani. The original 1931 building, designed by the noted Cleveland architecture firm Walker and Weeks, was seven stories tall and a 10 story addition to the structure was completed in 1958 with roughly 200,000 square feet of total space. The Art Deco facade of the original Georgia marble building is ornamented with three cast aluminum figures representing mining, agriculture and commerce by the New York sculptor, Henry Hering. The building was listed as a Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark in 2001. The Pittsburgh branch presides over Jefferson, Monroe and Belmont counties in Ohio and all of Western Pennsylvania.
Staff cuts and sale.
For decades, it shared responsibility with FRB Minneapolis for processing all US Savings Bond transactions, this service being provided by Federal Reserve System to the US Treasury. Employees numbered 300-350 in total at the complex. With the increase in electronic processing, the US Treasury determined that reduced staffing and only one Federal Reserve site was required for such services, and the operation in Minneapolis was named as the sole site. Pittsburgh branch staff was reduced during 2011-2012 from about 320 to 25 in three separate layoffs. Along with the consolidation in processing to Minneapolis and the staff cuts the Federal Reserve is currently considering selling the historic building as soon as 2013, though it will retain a branch staff in place in Pittsburgh for auditing and bank examination of roughly 20-25 beyond 2013.
Building sale to Drury Hotels.
On May 8, 2013 M&J Wilkow announced that it obtained an agreement to purchase the structure and either convert it into a hotel or offices, the Reserve staff having relocated to Oxford Centre in October 2012. In November 2013 Drury Hotels agree to convert the 1931 structure into a 180 room hotel to open by late 2015.

<doc id="21599073" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21599073" title="Gentamicin protection assay">
Gentamicin protection assay

The gentamicin protection assay or survival assay or invasion assay is a method used in microbiology. It is used to quantify the ability of pathogenic bacteria to invade eukaryotic cells.
The assay is based on several observations made in the 1970s, in which the ability of internalized bacteria to avoid killing by antibiotics was reported. The assay started to be used in biological research in the early 1980s.
Background and principle.
Intracellular bacteria need to enter host cells (cells of the infected organism) in order to replicate and propagate infection. Many species of "Shigella" (causes bacillary dysentery), "Salmonella" (typhoid fever), "Mycobacterium" (leprosy and tuberculosis) and "Listeria" (listeriosis), to name but a few, are intracellular.
Several antibiotics cannot penetrate eukaryotic cells. Therefore, these antibiotics cannot hurt intracellular bacteria that are already internalized. Using such antibiotics enables us to differentiate between bacteria that succeed in penetrating eukaryotic cells and those that do not. Applying such an antibiotic to a culture of eukaryotic cells infected with bacteria would kill the bacteria that remain outside the cells while sparing the ones that penetrated. The antibiotic of choice for this assay is the aminoglycoside gentamicin.
Procedure.
HeLa cells are commonly used as eukaryotic cells in the gentamicin protection assay, but other cells can be used as well. As for bacteria, only species susceptible to gentamicin can be assayed.
The assay is performed in polypropylene plates with round wells, which are commonly used in laboratories for culturing eukaryotic cells. The cells are allowed to grow in the wells overnight, creating a flat layer. Bacteria are separately grown overnight. On the next day the eukaryotic cells are inoculated with the bacteria and are incubated together for an hour. Centrifuging the plates for a few minutes may help bring cells and bacteria in contact and initiate infection.
After infection gentamicin is added to the plates, and they are incubated for an hour, allowing the antibiotic to kill all bacteria that were not able to penetrate the cells and remained outside. The plates are then washed well to remove the dead bacteria. Next the eukaryotic cells are lysed using a detergent, most commonly Triton X-100. 
The bacteria that penetrated the cells and remained alive are now released, and they are plated on solid medium plates. Counting the colonies formed on the plates on the next day, and knowing how many bacteria were used in the beginning of the assay, enables the researcher to calculate the percentage of bacteria that were able to invade the eukaryotic cells.
Usage, advantages and caveats.
The gentamicin protection assay is commonly used in pathogen research. The contribution of specific genes or proteins to the bacteria's ability to invade cells can be easily assayed using this method. The gene in question can be knocked out, and the bacteria's invasiveness compared with that of normal, wild type bacteria. Environmental conditions, such as pH level and temperature, can also be assayed for their effect on invasiveness.
The gentamicin protection assay is very sensitive, as it can detect the internalization of even single bacteria. It has several drawbacks:
To help assess the accuracy of a particular assay, positive and negative controls should be performed. When performing the assay as described above, bacteria that are known to be entirely invasive (positive control) and bacteria that are known as non-invasive (negative control) should be included in the assay.
An alternative invasion assay is the differential immunostaining assay, based on the binding of antibodies to bacteria before and after invasion. The antibodies emit fluorescent, colored light, and the results of this assay are viewed under the microscope.

Operation Diesel

Operation Diesel was a raid by 700 British troops from the Royal Marines 45 Commando, 42 Commando, and the 3 Commando Brigade's Reconnaissance Force, as well as armoured infantry and close reconnaissance from 1st Battalion Princess of Wales's Royal Regiment (1 PWRR) on a Taliban drug factory and arms stronghold in the Upper Sangin Valley in Helmand province, Afghanistan on February 7, 2009. According to the UK, the raid captured four drug factories and heroin and opium worth £50 million.
These figures were later found to be inaccurate. No heroin was found but 1260kg of opium and a large quantity of the chemicals needed to make heroin were found and destroyed. The 1260kg of opium would make roughly 130kg of heroin. The total value of the opium seized was approximately $126,000 based on the farmgate price of opium in Afghanistan. 
Twenty Taliban fighters defending the drugs were killed. No UK personnel were killed in the assault. The raiders also captured a motorbike which had been primed as a suicide bomb.

<doc id="21599109" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21599109" title="Fasad">
Fasad

"In some dialects and languages, the unrelated architectural term 'facade' is spelled 'fasad'."
Fasad (Arabic: ) is corruption, unlawful warfare, or crimes against law and order in the Muslim community. Fasad is a general concept of social disorder that, within Islamic jurisprudence, is the source of and basis for 'Hirabah'-related laws. 'Hirabah' refers to illegal acts done under the principle of fasad. In the Islamic Republic of Iran, this crime is known as "mofsede-fel-arz". 
In recent years, Islamic thinkers have defined acts of terrorism by Muslims as "fasad".
Appearances in the Quran.
The term "Fasad" appears in chapter 5 (Al-Ma'ida) of Qur'an, verse 32, in the phrase "mischief in the land" (fasaadin fi al-ard):
On that account: We ordained for the Children of Israel that if any one slew a person - unless it be for murder or for spreading mischief in the land - it would be as if he slew the whole people: and if any one saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life of the whole people. Then although there came to them Our messengers with clear signs, yet, even after that, many of them continued to commit excesses in the land. 
This verse follows verses 26-31 which refer to the incident in which Qabil (Cain), son of Adam, killed his brother Habil (Abel).
In chapter 18, (Al-Kahf) of the Qur'an, verse 94, The people of Gog and Magog make "mischief in the land" (mufsiduna fi al-ard):
They said, "O Zul-Qarnain, Gog and Magog make mischief in the land. Can we pay you to create a barrier between us and them?"
In chapter 2, (Al-Baqara), verse 11, it is said do not cause "corruption in the land" (tufsiduuna fi al-ard):
When it is said to them, "do not cause mischief in the land"...
Those who cause mischief in the land (yufsiduna fi al-ard)are counted as "the losers" in verse 27:
Those who break the covenant of Allah after ratifying it, and sever that which Allah ordered to be joined, and (who) make mischief in the earth: Those are they who are the losers
From the Tafsir of Ibn Kathir, "fasad fi al-ard" (mischief or corruption in the land/on earth) is the act of disobedience to God:
In his Tafsir, As-Suddi said that Ibn `Abbas and Ibn Mas`ud commented... As for,("Do not make mischief on the earth"), that is disbelief and acts of disobedience." Abu Ja`far said that Ar-Rabi` bin Anas said that Abu Al-`Aliyah said that Allah's statement,(And when it is said to them: "Do not make mischief on the earth,"), means, "Do not commit acts of disobedience on the earth. Their mischief is disobeying Allah, because whoever disobeys Allah on the earth, or commands that Allah be disobeyed, he has committed mischief on the earth. Peace on both the earth and in the heavens is ensured (and earned) through obedience (to Allah)." Ar-Rabi` bin Anas and Qatadah said similarly. 
Interpretations relating to Terrorism.
International Islamic University scholar M. Moniruzzaman defines the term as including both domestic and international terrorism as well as broader anti-social
activities such as extortion, organized crime, drug trafficking, and human trafficking.
M.J. Akbar, editor of the Indian magazine "Covert", has stated that, “Terrorism has no place in Islamic doctrine. The Koranic term for the killing of innocents is ‘fasad.’ Terrorists are fasadis, not jihadis. In a beautiful verse, the Koran says that the killing of an innocent is akin to slaying the whole community."

Liebeskind–Srogl coupling

The Liebeskind–Srogl coupling reaction is an organic reaction forming a new carbon–carbon bond from a thioester and a boronic acid using a metal catalyst. This reaction was invented and named after Jiri Srogl from the Academy of Sciences, Czech Republic, and Lanny S. Liebeskind from Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia, USA. The metal catalyst depicted below uses TFP = tris(2-furyl)phosphine as an additional ligand and CuTC = copper(I) thiophene-2-carboxylate as a co-metal catalyst. The overall reaction scheme is shown below.
Mechanism.
The proposed reaction mechanism is shown below. The thioester 1 complexes with copper complex 3 to form compound 4. With the oxidative insertion of into the carbon–sulfur bond, compound 5 is formed, and with transmetallation, organopalladium species 8 is formed. The transmetallation proceeds via the transfer of R2 to the palladium metal center with concomitant transfer of the sulfur atom to the copper complex. Reductive elimination gives ketone 3 with the regeneration of the active catalyst 9.

Maxwell Communications Corporation

Maxwell Communications Corporation plc was a leading British media business. It was listed on the London Stock Exchange and was a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index.
History.
The Company was established in 1964 when "Hazell Sun" merged with Purnell & Sons to form the "British Printing Corporation". In 1967 it acquired a majority stake in Haymarket Group from Michael Heseltine. During the 1970s the Company was involved in many disputes with trade unions. In 1978 such a dispute led to "The Times" and "Sunday Times" not being published for 10 months.
In July 1981 Robert Maxwell launched a dawn raid on the Company acquiring a stake of 29%; the following year he secured full control of it. He changed the name of the Company to "British Printing & Communications Corporation" in March 1982 and to "Maxwell Communications Corporation" in October 1987.
The Company acquired Macmillan Publishers, a large US publisher, in 1988. It went on to buy Science Research Associates and the Official Airline Guide later that year.
The Company went into administration in 1991 following the death of Robert Maxwell. Its properties were sold to various media companies.

Branchless banking

Branchless banking is a distribution channel strategy used for delivering financial services without relying on bank branches. While the strategy may complement an existing bank branch network for giving customers a broader range of channels through which they can access financial services, branchless banking can also be used as a separate channel strategy that entirely forgoes bank branches. According to a 2011 survey, 62% of respondents said the Internet is their preferred banking method. Only 20% selected branch banking - a sharp decline compared with 2007 when 40% of respondents preferred to bank at a branch.)
Examples of branchless banking technologies are the Internet, automated teller machines (ATMs), POS devices, EFTPOS devices and mobile phones. Each of these technologies serve to deliver a set of banking services and are part of distribution channels that may be used either separately or in conjunction to form the overall distribution channel strategy.
For example, Cooperative Bank of Kenya uses the Internet, ATMs, POS devices, EFTPOS devices, and mobile phones as technologies to deliver its banking services through a combination of distribution channels including stationary bank branches, mobile bank branches, ATMs, bank agents, Online banking, and mobile banking. All of these are distribution channels, yet only the last four are branchless distribution channels and form part of Equity Banks's branchless banking strategy (Equity Bank refers to its branchless banking channels as "alternate delivery channels").
First Direct in the United Kingdom are an early pioneer of this class of service. Launched by the then-Midland Bank (now part of HSBC) in 1989, first direct's accounts are operated solely via the Internet, post, or (principally) telephone, and they do not themselves operate any retail branches (although HSBC branches can be used to make deposits) while at the same time offering a full range of banking services. Smile are a similar venture, again operating solely via the Internet and telephone.
Branchless banking technologies and distribution channels should be distinguished from each other as the two may overlap, which can be confusing: ATMs and mobile phones can be technologies and distribution channels, while POS and EFTPOS devices are only technologies but not distribution channels—rather, the latter two technologies are placed at points of sale through other distribution channels such as agents, which are usually retail outlets that allow their customers to pay for purchases by using their debit or credit cards. For an overview of distribution channels and technologies used in branchless banking and how they differ, see Porteous (2008, p. 4).
A success story is Pakistan’s first branchless banking solution, Easypaisa, launched jointly by Telenor Pakistan and Tameer Microfinance Bank in October 2009 after Tameer Microfinance Bank received the license from the State Bank of Pakistan in 2008. Committed to providing financial inclusion to the people of Pakistan, easypaisa shops are present at over 22,000 outlets in more than 750 cities and towns in the country. Nearly 4 million unique users use easypaisa services every month for basic financial services like Utility Bill Payments, Money Transfer and Mobile Accounts. Around 117 million transactions worth over Rs. 261 billion have been carried out through Easypaisa since launch.
Mobile phone branchless banking.
Mobile phone branchless banking has successfully function mainly in Kenya with 7 million customers, followed by South Africa and Philippines.
On March 2011, a pilot project mobile phone branchless banking has been launched at Bali, Indonesia by the country's biggest bank.

International Federation for Learning, Education, and Training Systems Interoperability

The International Federation for Learning, Education, and Training Systems Interoperability (LETSI) is an international nonprofit organization focused on enabling technical interoperability for computer-based learning, education, and training systems. Comprising e-learning vendors, adopters, standards bodies, associations, and policy makers, LETSI's primary activity is to support the adoption of open software standards in learning systems. The LETSI community formed around an international planning effort for the next generation of the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM), which was originally created by the U.S. Advanced Distributed Learning Initiative. LETSI was founded in March, 2008 to serve the international SCORM community.
History.
In 1997 the U.S. Department of Defense founded the Advanced Distributed Learning (ADL) Initiative, with the mission of improving "access to education, training, and performance aids, tailored to individual needs, delivered cost effectively, anytime and anywhere." 
In January 2000, the ADL released the first edition of the Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM), a technical framework designed to facilitate interoperability of computer-based education and training materials. Though developed for use within the DoD, SCORM became widely adopted in commercial, educational, government, and international projects.
Recognizing that SCORM had acquired an international constituency across a broad spectrum of markets, the ADL in 2005 determined that an "international collaborative approach" was required in order to meet the needs of the SCORM user base, and resolved that "an international stewardship organisation shall be established and become fully functional within a three-year period."
In March 2007, representatives from Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hungary, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, Tunisia, the United Kingdom, and the United States assembled at the London Institute for Education to discuss the formation of LETSI. 
In March 2008, the LETSI founding sponsors signed a Memorandum of Understanding in Seoul, Korea about their common goals and principles and approved LETSI’s Operating Procedures Pro Tem.
In August, 2008, LETSI held the first SCORM 2.0 conference, in Pensacola, Florida.
Governance.
LETSI adheres to an open development process. The public may view meeting minutes, committee decisions, and materials related to work in progress at no cost through the LETSI wiki. Nonmembers may contribute comments, case studies, and other inputs to LETSI through the wiki. Voting, however, requires membership, which involves an annual fee.
Outputs of LETSI, such as a new SCORM reference model, are planned to be public and non-proprietary. 
LETSI currently operates under IEEE Industry Standards and Technology Organization (ISTO) interim procedures. The Sponsors' Executive Committee (SEC), which is composed of sponsors, serves as LETSI’s governing body.
Working Groups.
LETSI activities are organized into the following working groups, each responsible for a different area of the next SCORM:
Software Outputs.
To increase consistency of adoption and to decrease time-to-market for innovation, LETSI plans to develop enabling software components (for example, code for RESTful and SOAP-based web services) and other tools for developers. These tools will be available to developers free of charge.

At times here they fall short – slingshot aimed at the moon short – but often their aim rings true. And on these occasions they are devastating."

Larry Zierlein

Larry Zierlein (born July 12, 1945 in Norton, Kansas) is a long-time American football coach at high school, college, and currently Assistant Line Coach for the NFL Arizona Cardinals.
Biography.
Zierlein grew up in Lenora, Kansas. After spending two years in the Marines from 1966–1968, including a tour of duty in Vietnam in 1967, he attended Fort Hays State College. He played defensive end for Fort Hays State in 1969 before graduating in 1971.
Coaching career.
Zierlein embarked on his coaching career as a graduate assistant and linebackers coach at his alma mater in 1970. After two years coaching at Fort Hays State, he spent the following six seasons (1972–1977) as a high school assistant in Texas. In 1978 he returned to the college game at the University of Houston where he served as offensive line coach for nine seasons.
In 1987 he got his first professional experience as an assistant with the Washington Commandos of the Arena Football League. When the Commandos went on hiatus the next year, Zierlein took a job at Tulane where he worked the next three seasons before returning to the pro ranks with the New York/New Jersey Knights of the National Football League's development league, the World League of American Football. With the Knights he held the title of offensive coordinator under Mouse Davis as well as coaching the offensive line. When the Knights folded in 1992, Zierlein once more headed back to college, this time at LSU.
Zierlein spent two years at LSU, coaching the offensive line under head coach Curley Hallman. In 1995 he returned to Tulane, this time for what would be a two year stint under Tommy Bowden. In 1997 he moved on to the University of Cincinnati as the running game coordinator and offensive line coach under Rick Minter.
In 2001, Zierlein gained his first NFL experience with the Cleveland Browns. He served for four seasons as the Brown's o-line coach under the Butch Davis regime. Zierlein's current Steelers colleague Bruce Arians served as the offensive coordinator for the first three of Zierlein's seasons at Clevelend. He returned from a one year absence from football in 2006 as the assistant o-line coach for the Buffalo Bills under Dick Jauron. 
When Mike Tomlin was hired as the Pittsburgh Steelers new head coach in 2007, he brought Zierlein to Pittsburgh to coach the offensive line. Tomlin and Zierlein had previously worked together in 1999–2000 with the Cincinnati Bearcats. Steelers assistant special teams coach Amos Jones was also a member of that Bearcats coaching staff. Zierlein was relieved of his duties with the Steelers on January 6, 2010.
E-mail gaffe.
Zierlein gained unwanted notoriety in 2007 when he mistakenly forwarded an inappropriate e-mail to a large number of high-level NFL employees, including commissioner Roger Goodell. The e-mail, which Zierlein had received from Steelers pro personnel coordinator Doug Whaley contained a pornographic video. Zierlein apologized for the gaffe, but was not disciplined by the team or the league.
Personal.
Zierlein and his wife, Marcia, have three children and several grandchildren. Their son, Lance, is a sports talk radio host at Houston's "Sports talk 790" and a blogger for the Houston Chronicle. Their son Mike (Lance's brother) is now the Head Football Coach at Clear Falls High School in League City, Texas.

The Medea hypothesis is a term coined by paleontologist Peter Ward for the anti-Gaian hypothesis that multicellular life, understood as a superorganism, is suicidal; in this view microbial-triggered mass extinctions are attempts to return the Earth to the microbial dominated state it has been for most of its history. It is named after the mythological Medea, who killed her own children. Medea represents the Earth, and her children are multicellular life.

128th Infantry Regiment (United States)

The 128th Infantry Regiment ("Les Terribles") is a United States military unit of the Wisconsin National Guard. The 128th has served as part of the American Civil War, Spanish-American War, Mexican Civil War, World War I, World War II and the Iraq War.
History.
The 1st Battalion, 128th Infantry, traces its history to the spring of 1861, when the 2nd Regiment of Wisconsin Volunteer infantry, comprising independent companies from throughout the state, was organized and activated into federal service. The 2nd Wisconsin was joined by several other regiments to form the famous "Iron Brigade," which soon became one of the most feared and respected units on either side in the Civil War for its performance in such battles as Antietam and Gettysburg. Additionally, Eau Claire was home to the soldiers that comprised Company C of the 8th Infantry, otherwise known as the "Eagle Regiment," because of its famous mascot "Old Abe." The 8th Wisconsin fought in the western theater at places such as Vicksburg, MS. 
In 1898, four infantry regiments from Wisconsin were formed and activated at the outbreak of the Spanish-American War. During that brief conflict, Wisconsin Guardsmen participated in the capture of Puerto Rico. 
In 1916, Wisconsin infantry units served with General Pershing to chase Pancho Villa along the Texas border and into northern Mexico. The Wisconsin troops were again activated in 1917 as the U.S. declared war on Germany. After a period of intensive training, the Wisconsin Guardsmen were redesignated as the 128th Infantry, assigned to the 32nd Division and sent to France. In the closing months of the war, the 128th Infantry participated in several major campaigns including Alsace, Aisne-Marne, Oise-Aisne and Meuse-Argonne. For their fury in combat, the nickname "Les Terribles" or "The Terrible Ones" was given to them by the French. As they pierced the famed Hindenburg Line, the 32d Infantry Division became known as the "Red Arrow" Division - a name that has remained to the present day and is reflected in shoulder patch. 
21 years later, the 128th, as part of the 32d Division, was called to federal service on 15 October 1940. After training in Louisiana, the unit was moved by convoy to Port Adelaide, Australia. The 128th, as part of the 32d, broke through the Japanese lines at Buna ("Bloody Buna") New Guinea; defeated Japanese General Adachi's divisions at Saidor and Aitape, New Guinea; defeated the Japanese Imperial First Marines in Leyte (Imperial First Marines only loss in 200 years); and pierced the Yamashita Line in Luzon. The 128th Regiment and 32d Division were still in combat action when the cease fire order came on 15 Aug. 1945. The 32d Infantry Division had been in combat 654 days - more than any U.S. division in any war. 
When the cold war peaked with the Soviet blockade of Berlin in October 1961, President Kennedy became the third U.S. president in the 20th Century to call the 128th, as part of the 32d Infantry Division, to federal active service. The division trained at Ft. Lewis, WA, for 10 months, maintaining a high level of readiness until the crisis abated. In August 1962 its soldiers returned home and resumed their status as Wisconsin National Guardsmen. 
The 2nd Battalion, 128th Infantry, was formed as a result of the transitioning of the 32d Infantry Brigade from a mechanized unit to a separate light infantry brigade in September 2001.
Distinctive unit insignia.
A metal and enamel device 1 1/16 inches (2.70 cm) in height overall consisting of a shield blazoned as follows: Azure, on a pale Or the shoulder sleeve insignia of the 32d Division Proper (a Red arrow having shot through a line), on a chief of the second three fountains. Attached above on a wreath of the colors Or and Azure, a badger couchant Proper. Attached below and to the sides a Gold scroll inscribed "LES TERRIBLES" in Blue letters. 
The shield is blue for Infantry. The pale, dividing the shield into thirds, alludes to three of the major offensive engagements in which the organization as an element of the 32d Division participated in World War I. The red arrow is the design of the shoulder sleeve insignia of the 32d Division. Traditionally, the word "Wisconsin" means "wild rushing waters," thus the three fountains, heraldic symbols for water, appropriately stand for the Wisconsin Army National Guard regiments: First, Second and Third, from which elements stemmed to make up the organization during World War I. The motto translates to "The Terrible Ones." 
The distinctive unit insignia was approved on 15 March 1926. It was amended to revise the description on 20 April 1926.

Jingle All the Way (Béla Fleck and the Flecktones album)

Jingle All the Way is a Christmas album and the thirteenth album overall by Béla Fleck and the Flecktones. Released in 2008 under Rounder, it marks the band's first record since their departure from Columbia. "Jingle All the Way" reached #1 on the Top Contemporary Jazz chart, the group's first album to do so since 1991. It also won the 2009 Grammy Award for Best Pop Instrumental Album.
The band's rendition of "Sleigh Ride" was nominated for Best Country Instrumental Performance.
It was performed on the December 28, 2008 edition of "Late Night with Conan O'Brien".
Overview.
In an interview with "Billboard", Béla Fleck described the band's desire to record Christmas songs:
One of the album's most ambitious tracks, "The Twelve Days of Christmas," builds up to 12 different keys and 12 different time signatures over the course of the tune. "Jingle All the Way" also features a medley which fuses several Christmas classics and as Fleck described, "five or six are being played together, simultaneously." Indeed, the song includes “We Wish You a Merry Christmas,” “Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer,” and “My Favorite Things” and has been performed at Flecktones concerts for years prior to its 2008 studio recording. Guests on the album include Andy Statman, Edgar Meyer, and the Alash Ensemble, who specialize in Tuvan throat singing.
Fleck also described to "The Washington Post", who named the band Editors' Pick in December 2008, how the Flecktones wanted to avoid holiday music clichés:
He went on to describe how, while much of the Flecktones' music is complex and not easily digestible to some music fans, "Christmas music is inside everyone's DNA" and that it creates a doorway for them to understand the Flecktones' unique music.
A U.S. tour intended to highlight much of the "Jingle All The Way" material began November 15, 2008 in Spokane, Washington and concluded with a four-night run at the Blue Note in New York.
Reception.
Critically, "Jingle All the Way" is widely praised as a unique and engaging jazz-infused twist on classic holiday songs. Juli Thanki of PopMatters praised "Jingle All the Way" for its reinvention of "tired songs." She commented, "Fleck and his bandmates keep the improvisational noodling to a minimum, making this an enjoyable album for jazz fans and nonfans alike while still maintaining the integrity of these holiday classics."
Despite his criticism of the album's uncreative title and photography, Allmusic's James Christopher Monger considered "Jingle All the Way" "anything but predictable." He added that the "notoriously monotonous" holiday music is "filtered through the skewed prism of an outfit capable of just about anything from klezmer, to classical to Tuvan throat singing."
The Flecktones were named "The Washington Post" Editors' Pick in December 2008. "Post" writer Geoffrey Himes described the innovative tweaks the Flecktones put on classic tunes and added, "They slow down for 'Silent Night' and prove they are just as capable of coaxing the feeling out of a simple melody as they are at quadrupling the number of notes per measure."

Wake Forest.
Pregame Line: Wake Forest +16
GT vs. Wake Forest Demon Deacons
The Yellow Jackets, ranked in the Top 10 for the first time since 1999, hosted the Demon Deacons in Atlanta. The game got off to a quick start as Tech jumped out to a quick 10–0 lead helped by Preston Lyons first career TD. But the Deacons controlled the rest of the first half scoring 17 unanswered points. The Yellow Jackets kept committing penalties, contributing to all of Wake Forest's points. The offense also had its share of mistakes, getting called three times for chop blocks as the officials seemed to pay close attention to the interior line after opponents complained of dirty blocking tactics. After trailing 17–10 at the half, Tech's Jonathan Dwyer broke off a 59-yard TD run on Georgia Tech's first offensive snap of the second half, tying the game at 17. Wake Forest managed only one first down on its four possessions after halftime, and Georgia Tech went ahead 24–17 when Josh Nesbitt scored on a 12-yard run with 8:19 left in regulation. Wake Forest QB Riley Skinner drove the Deacons down late in the 4th quarter and threw an 11-yard touchdown pass to Devon Brown with 4:27 remaining. After Georgia Tech was stopped again on fourth down, Wake Forest appeared to be driving into range for a winning field-goal attempt. But Skinner was sacked by Derrick Morgan on third-and-7 from the Georgia Tech 35, and Wake Forest decided to punt it away and settle for OT. In the first period of OT, the Yellow Jacket defense was able to hold Wake Forest to a field goal helped by a Derrick Morgan sack on Riley Skinner on a 3rd and seven. On the Jacket's OT possession, Georgia Tech drove to the 5 where it faced fourth-and-less-than-a-yard. The Yellow Jackets initially tried to draw Wake offsides, but was forced to burn a timeout when that didn't work. Deciding to go for the first instead of kicking a field goal, Josh Nesbitt got the first down on a QB sneak. On the very next play, the Jackets were able to get into the endzone thanks to another Josh Nesbitt sneak and was able to seal the victory. The victory lifted Tech to a 9–1 record and dropped the Deacons to 4–6. The Yellow Jacket offense, also known as the Nesbone, rumbled up and down Grant Field for 412 yards, Coach Johnson's sixth 400 plus rushing yard performance in two seasons.

Tony Richards (footballer)

Anthony Willis "Tony" Richards (6 March 1934 – 4 March 2010) was an English footballer who played as a forward.
Associated with Birmingham City as a teenager, he joined Walsall in 1954. He became the club's top scorer for five successive seasons, firing the "Saddlers" to two successive promotion from the Fourth Division into the Second Division in 1959–60 and 1960–61. After 185 goals in 334 league games for the club, he was sold on to Port Vale for £9,000 in March 1963. Twice becoming the club's top scorer, a series of injuries brought his career to a close, and he moved into non-league football in May 1966 with Nuneaton Borough and Dudley Town.
Early life.
Richards was in the Army from 1952 to his demobbing in 1954, playing football (as captain) for the Battery and Regimental team whilst serving in Egypt.
Playing career.
Richards started his career with Birmingham City, but did not make a league appearance for the club before joining Walsall in 1954. Walsall finished 23rd in the 24 team Third Division South in 1954–55 under the stewardship of Frank Buckley, and were forced to apply for re-election. They rose to 20th in 1955–56 under John Love, and then 15th in 1956–57. Richards came to prominence after Bill Moore was appointed manager, and finished as the club's top scorer in 1957–58 with 20 goals, as a 20th place finish meant that Walsall became founder members of the Fourth Division. He scored 28 goals in 1958–59, as his team posted a sixth place finish, two places and six points behind promoted Shrewsbury Town. His 26 goals in 1959–60 helped to fire Walsall to the top of the table, a clear five points ahead of second place Notts County. He was the highest goal scorer in the Third Division in 1960–61 with 36 goals, as he fired the "Saddlers" to a second successive promotion as runners-up, six points behind champions Bury. His 20 goals in 1961–62 helped to secure the club's place in the Second Division. However they were relegated in 1962–63, as for the first time in six seasons Richards was not the club's top goalscorer. In his nine years at Fellows Park, Richards scored 185 goals in 334 league games, and became the club's second-highest goal scorer. 
He joined Freddie Steele's Port Vale for £9,000 in March 1963. Amazingly, with 13 goals in 14 games in the 1962–63 season he had become the club's top scorer despite only playing for three months of the season. The following season, with nine months to play in, a leg injury Richards suffered in September meant he was only able to re-create his previous season's record; scoring 13 goals in 34 games, once more becoming the club's top scorer. He hit a hat-trick against Bristol City in a 4–1 win at Vale Park on 31 August 1963. However he began to be plagued by injuries at Vale, missing the start of the 1964–65 relegation season after suffering the effects of an insect bite. In September 1964 he sustained a cartilage injury that required surgery. He scored five goals in 20 appearances in 1965–66, but he never really recovered after his operation, and was given a free transfer by manager Jackie Mudie in May 1966.
He finished his career with non-league clubs Nuneaton Borough and Dudley Town. Before he died, Richards was appointed an Honorary Life President of Walsall, to mark his contribution to the club and his cult status amongst the club's fans.
Death.
Richards died on 4 March 2010, two days before what would have been his 76th birthday. A minute's silence was held before Walsall's 2–2 draw with Millwall on 7 March as a tribute to Richards and Macclesfield Town manager Keith Alexander, who had died on 3 March.

Sean Delonas

Sean Delonas is an American political cartoonist and author whose work was for 23 years published by the "New York Post" as part of their Page Six content.
Life and career.
Delonas graduated from the New York Academy of Art. Delonas is author of the children's book "Scuttle's Big Wish" (a retelling of the story of King Midas), and illustrator for "Willowood" and "Jackie Mason & Raoul Felder's Survival Guide to New York City". His work has also appeared on the cover of another Rupert Murdoch-owned publication, "The Weekly Standard". He painted the altar triptych for the Church of St. Agnes in New York.
Controversies.
His work has been criticized as "ham-handed", and he has been accused of "churning out malevolent fantasies." Conversely, he has also been praised for his irreverent visual imagination, and described as "a bizarre cross between Jack Davis of "Mad Magazine" and Hieronymous Bosch."
A 1999 cartoon depicted Louis Farrakhan about to undergo surgery for recently-diagnosed cancer, with the surgeons preparing to cut through his neck to remove "the cancerous tumor from Farrakhan's body." A 2001 cartoon showing rival editor Mortimer B. Zuckerman of the "New York Daily News" sending anthrax to "Post" editor Col Allan led to sponsor withdrawal.
After a photoshopped picture of the Sesame Street muppet Bert standing alongside Osama bin Laden went viral when it turned up on a pro-Osama placard, the website which included it (Bert is Evil) was taken down. Referencing this, in the "Post", Delonas did a series of depictions of Bert instructing and training Taliban and Al Qaida terrorists.
In 2009, two days after a local chimpanzee mauling and one day after legislation was signed into law by President Barack Obama, Delonas depicted two white police officers who just shot and killed a chimpanzee. One officer says, "They'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill." The cartoon was widely criticized as in bad taste and as making a reference to the racial slur of African Americans being portrayed as apes. Protests came from journalists, politicians, police groups, and the public. Many people disputed this interpretation and defended Delonas. The "Post" apologized "to those who were offended by the image."

Mullah Abdul Kayum Sakir is the name of a citizen of Afghanistan the "BBC News" reported had been held in extrajudicial detention in the United States's Guantanamo Bay detention camps, in Cuba, only to assume a senior leadership position with the Taliban, in Pakistan, upon his release.
The "BBC" reports British officials told them "Abdul Kayum Sakir" was repatriated to Afghan custody in the Spring of 2008. 
Five Afghans were repatriated on April 30, 2008, but none of their names comes close to "Abdul Kayum Sakir".
"Abdul Kayum Sakir" does not match the name of any of the captives on the Department of Defense's official list of captives' names.
The BBC reports that Abdul Kayum Sakir played a leadership role in planning attacks on NATO forces; 
that he "operates with impunity from Quetta, Pakistan; 
that he was briefly imprisoned near Kabul, after his repatriation.
According to "The Christian Science Monitor", a member of the Quetta Shura named "Mullah Abdul Qayoum Zakir" was captured by Pakistani authorities in February 2010, though further reports later denied this. Zakir's arrest was also reported by Newsweek.

After 9/11, Foley decided that what he really wanted to do was act. So he started acting. “I was feeling like life was not giving me what I needed,” he said. “I felt like something was missing, so I decided to make a change and try my hand at acting. I never looked back.”
Foley is from Boston and is best known for his role of Bluey Batchelder in the movie The Golden Boys.

Fortress of São Francisco do Penedo

The Fortress of São Francisco do Penedo (in Portuguese, Forte de São Francisco do Penedo) is located in the port city of Luanda, Angola, at coordinates .
History.
In the 17th Century, by order of Philip II of Portugal, a Commission was created to study how the strategic port city of Luanda could be fortified.
One of the expected buildings to protect the city of Luanda, was the Fortress of Penedo. So, the Fortress would come to guarantee the safety of European occupation, giving resistance to the network of the traffic of the slaves, who were sent to America, from the harbour of Luanda.
The Fortress of Penedo was, since its first building, one of the keys of the Luanda harbour protection. And secretly it cantoned the slaves and assured their sending to the lands of "New World" (America).
The new fortress was built between 1765 and 1766, and was also used as Prison of the Portuguese Political Police.
This Fortress is badly preserved due to its age and its activity as a Prison.
World Heritage Status.
This site was added to the UNESCO World Heritage Tentative List on November 22, 1996 in the Cultural category.

Palm Court (Alexandria Hotel)

The Palm Court, also known at other times as the Franco-Italian Dining Room, the Grand Ballroom and the Continental Room, is a ballroom at the Hotel Alexandria in downtown Los Angeles, California. In its heyday from 1911 to 1922, it was the scene of speeches by U.S. Presidents William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson and Gen. John J. Pershing. It is also the room where Paul Whiteman, later known as the "Jazz King", got his start as a bandleader in 1919, where Rudolph Valentino danced with movie starlets, and where Hollywood held its most significant balls during the early days of the motion picture business. Known for its history and its stained-glass Tiffany skylight, noted Los Angeles columnist Jack Smith called it "surely the most beautiful room in Los Angeles". The Palm Court was designated as a City of Los Angeles Historic-Cultural Monument (HCM#80) in 1971.
Palm Court's heyday 1911-1922.
Built in 1906, the eight-story Hotel Alexandria was designed by noted Los Angeles architect John Parkinson. In 1911, the firm of Parkinson and Bergstrom was hired to design an addition that would double the capacity. The Palm Court was part of the 1911 addition. When the design of the new "crystal palmroom" was announced, the "Los Angeles Times" wrote:
"The room will be one of the largest of its kind in California and will be available for social affairs of every nature. Its primary object, however, will be more of a furnishing a convenient place for afternoon teas, card parties and evening receptions."
When the new ballroom opened in October 1911, it was acknowledged for its beauty. The room was "christened" in a gala attended by 385 of the city's "most prominent names." The Alexandria orchestra played throughout the evening," and the "Los Angeles Times" reported the next day on the city's spectacular new room:"The great room, over one hundred feet in length and seventy-five feet in width, was a sunburst of light. Great crystal chandeliers blazed from a dozen vantage points, while softer and smaller lights were placed along the four sides of the room. ... The perfection and symphony of the great room held the guests spellbound upon their arrival. As the stately ladies and gentlemen entered the salon the pause each made at the threshold as with intense interest they swept the salon with their gaze was noticeable."
For the next 12 years (until the opening of the Biltmore in 1923), the Palm Court was the city's most prestigious ballroom event location, hosting receptions for the likes of President Woodrow Wilson and Gen. John J. Pershing, as well as balls where Hollywood's silent film stars and early movie moguls mingled. By 1912, the Alexandria had become such an important gathering place that the "Los Angeles Times" wrote the following:"What Union Square was to old New York, what Forty-second street is to the present metropolis, and what the vicinity of the Cort Theater is to San Francisco, the Alexandria mezzanine seems to be to theatrical Los Angeles. ... Hardly ever does the day pass in which some nationally-known actor or actress does not linger in the low settees or pause at the golden rail, looking down into the lobby below -- pausing, lingering, while in whispered tones behind rises the chatter that his or her presence has caused."
Rudolph Valentino, whose untimely death at age 31 caused mass hysteria among his female fans, was a regular visitor to the dances held at the Alexandria's great ballroom. Actress Claire Windsor recalled that, when she and Valentino were "$5-a-day extras", they rode the streetcar from Westlake Park to dance in the Palm Court. Silent movie actress Mary MacLaren later recalled that her mother had "blighted a blossoming romance" with Valentino when she would not allow her to go dancing with "Rudy" at the Alexandria. A third actress, Marjorie Bennett, also recalled meeting Valentino at a tea dance at the Alexandria, when Valentino was "a handsome aspiring Italian actor, Rodolpho d'Antonguolla."
In the Alexandria's heyday, movie stars and other celebrities, including Valentino, Mary Miles Minter, Sarah Bernhardt, Enrico Caruso and Jack Dempsey were guests. Charlie Chaplin reportedly kept a suite at the Alexandria and did improvisations in the lobby, and western star Tom Mix reportedly rode his horse through the lobby. The large oriental rug in the lobby was called the "million-dollar carpet", because there was purportedly a $1 million worth of business done there every day. It was there that D.W. Griffith, Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks met in 1919 to form United Artists. U.S. Presidents Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft and Woodrow Wilson, and many foreign dignitaries, also stayed at the hotel while visiting Los Angeles.
Notable events from the Palm Court's heyday.

Decline and use for boxing events.
The hotel declined after the Biltmore opened in 1923 and replaced the Alexandria as the city's most prestigious hotel. The opening of the luxurious Biltmore put an immediate dent in the Alexandria's business. In October 1923, the "Los Angeles Times" wrote: "The exodus of the Associated Cofraternity of Lobby Loungers of Los Angeles was completed yesterday from the Hotel Alexandria to the new Hotel Biltmore. Its members, like members of similar organizations in all large cities, must have the very newest in hotels ..." By 1932, the Alexandria Hotel Realty Company was bankrupt, leaving $1,159,000 in outstanding bonds. In February 1934, the Alexandria closed its doors, and many of its finest furnishings and fixtures were stripped and sold, including the famed million-dollar rug, marble columns, chandeliers, and gold leaf covering of the mezzanine lobby. The hotel reopened in 1937 but declined again in the 1950s and became a transient hotel. 
During the 1950s and 1960s, the Grand Ballroom (as the Palm Court was then known) was used as a training ring for boxers. In 1958, Pajarito Moreno drew crowds of 800 people to his training camp at the Palm Room prior to his featherweight title match with Kid Bassey. Sports columnist Braven Dyer noted, that on learning that Moreno was training in a ballroom, his barber sarcastically commented, "A ballroom, yet! What's this frijole expect? That he's gonna have hisself a ball with this here Hogan Bassey? Or maybe he's training for a waltz? Why didn't he go get Fred Astaire for a sparrin' pardner?"
In 1960, a "Los Angeles Times" article described the scene at the Palm Room where a dollar bought admission to watch world bantamweight boxing champion Jose Becerra and welterweight Battling Torres training for fights to be held at the Coliseum:"You enter the Alexandria Hotel and find the lobby liberally sprinkled with knots of people, most of them Latin. They lounge lazily and converse in low tones. But when the door marked 'Palm Room' is thrown open, the scene suddenly becomes animated. Everybody surges toward that door, including women with babies in their arms or toddlers at their sides. ... The admission charge is $1, and bills rain down on the man at the little desk, though some don't appear to be that affluent."
Noting that Woodrow Wilson had once given a speech in the same room, the writer observed: "The (boxing) session ends to long applause -- probably more than President Wilson received. After all, he packed no punch."
Restoration and historic recognition.
Following a restoration in the 1980s, noted "Los Angeles Times" columnist Jack Smith noted, "It is a room of excellent proportions, and softly lighted by its lovely oval skylight, it is surely the most beautiful room in Los Angeles." In 2005, the "Los Angeles Times" called the Palm Court an architectural gem:"Then there are the Alexandria's architectural gems -- the magnificent Palm Court ballroom with its stained-glass Tiffany skylight, for example -- that made it the most luxurious hotel of its era. It was the film industry's first home in the early 1900s, a place where dozens of studios maintained offices, where Charlie Chaplin and friends formed United Artists, where the lobby bustled with so many deal makers that a Persian rug there was deemed the 'million-dollar carpet.'"
The Palm Court was designated a Historic Cultural Monument (HCM #80) in 1971. As of 2008, the Alexandria had been converted to apartments.
Blankenship Ballet at Alexandria in Palm Court.
In 2009, the Blankenship Ballet Company established its artistic residence at the Alexandria Hotel with the goal of revitalizing the Palm Court. In May 2010 the Blankenship Ballet Company created and produced the ballet-in-the-round "Cuban Ballet & Dance Extravaganza" featuring many ballet dancers formerly from the Ballet Nacional de Cuba.

SGCZ

Sarcoglycan zeta also known as SGCZ is a protein which in humans is encoded by the "SGCZ" gene.
Function.
The zeta-sarcoglycan gene measures over 465 kb and localizes to 8p22. This protein is part of the sarcoglycan complex, a group of 6 proteins. The sarcoglycans are all N-glycosylated transmembrane proteins with a short intra-cellular domain, a single transmembrane region and a large extra-cellular domain containing a carboxyl-terminal cluster with several conserved cysteine residues. The sarcoglycan complex is part of the dystrophin-associated glycoprotein complex (DGC), which bridges the inner cytoskeleton and the extracellular matrix.
Clinical significance.
Zeta-sarcoglycan is reduced in mouse models of muscular dystrophy and SGCZ is found as a component of the vascular smooth muscle sarcoglycan complex. Hence SGCZ may be important in the pathogenesis of muscular dystrophy.

William Lionel Wyllie

William Lionel Wyllie (often simply W L Wyllie) (London 5 July 1851 – 6 April 1931 London) was a prolific English painter of maritime themes in both oils and watercolours.
Life and career.
Birth.
Wyllie was born on 5 July 1851 at 67 Albany Street, Camden, London, the elder son of William Morrison Wyllie (1820–1895), a prosperous minor-genre painter living in London and Wimereux, France. by his wife Katherine Benham (1813–1872), a singer. Before marrying W M Wyllie she had had three children by Percy Clinton Sydney Smythe, 6th Viscount Strangford. One of these, Wyllie's half-brother Lionel Percy Smythe, also made a name for himself as an artist.
Early Life and Education.
Most of Wyllie's early summers were spent in France with his parents. He began to draw from an early age, and his natural talent was encouraged by his father and by Lionel Smythe, his step brother. He was given a thorough artistic education; first at the Heatherley School of Fine Art, and then in 1866, aged 15, at the Royal Academy Schools. At the Royal Academy he studied under Edwin Henry Landseer, John Everett Millais and Frederic Leighton, among others. He further demonstrated his precocious talent when he won the Turner Gold Medal in 1869 at the age of eighteen with "Dawn after a Storm". His other early love affair, which he shared with his younger brother and fellow artist Charles William Wyllie, was sailing.
Artistic career.
From the early 1870s Wyllie worked as an illustrator of maritime subjects for "The Graphic". In 1875 the Academy rejected two of his works, and in anger he declared his intention to give up art for a career at sea. Over the course of several sailing cruises as far afield as Europe he laid the foundations for a lifelong love of the sea and of maritime subjects.
Wyllie was a prolific exhibitor, with paintings and etchings shown at the Royal Academy, the Royal Institute of Oil Painters, the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours, the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers, the Grosvenor Gallery, the New English Art Club, the Society of British Artists, the Dowdeswell Galleries and the Fine Art Society.
Wyllie became a member of the Society of British Artists in 1875, and of the Royal Institute of Painters in Water Colours in 1882. In 1887 he became a member of the New English Art Club. In 1889 he was made an associate of the Royal Academy, and in 1907 he was elected as a full member. In 1903 he became a member of the Royal Society of Painter-Etchers and Engravers.
Wyllie campaigned vigorously for the restoration of HMS "Victory" as a founder member of the Society for Nautical Research, and in 1930 his panorama of the Battle of Trafalgar was unveiled by King George V. The painting is seen by about 100,000 people every year where it still hangs in the Royal Naval Museum within the Historic Dockyard at Portsmouth.
Wyllie was the most distinguished marine artist of his day and his work is still in great demand. From 1906, when he moved to Portsmouth, he became closely associated with the Royal Navy. So much so, indeed, that he was buried with full naval honours in 1931. In a moving ceremony, reminiscent of Nelson’s state funeral in 1806, his body was rowed up Portsmouth Harbour in a naval cutter past battleships with dipped colours and bugles calling and quaysides lined with dockyard workers.
Marriage.
In 1876, at the age of 25, he became engaged to the 16-year old Marion Amy Carew (31 December 1860–26 July 1937). They were married in 1879, and between 1880 and 1904 she bore him nine children; Harold (1880–1973), Bill (1882–1916), Dick (b 1883), Eva (1884–1912), Robert (1888–1914), Douglas (b&d 1894), an unnamed son (b&d 1898), Eric (b 1900) and Aileen (1903–1987). Bill and Robert were killed in the First World War and Eva also died before her father.
Death.
Remaining active in his final years, Wyllie continued to sail and paint. His work on the Trafalgar panorama was physically difficult, with much of the painting being done from step ladders, and on most days the work lasted from 10:00 until 17:00 with a short sleep at lunchtime. His daughter Aileen later remarked "At the time it seemed natural, but now that I am old, I cannot think how he did those hours on ladders in his 79th year." Wyllie died on 6 April 1931 at 102 Fellows Road, Primrose Hill, London, and is buried at St Mary's church, within the grounds of Portchester Castle.

Zero (Yeah Yeah Yeahs song)

"Zero" is a song by American indie rock band Yeah Yeah Yeahs, released as the lead single from their third studio album, "It's Blitz!" (2009).
Critical reception.
"Zero" was named the best track of 2009 by both the "NME" and "Spin" magazine. In October 2011, the "NME" placed it at number thirty-nine on its list of the "150 Best Tracks of the Past 15 Years".
Music video.
The music video for "Zero" was directed by Barney Clay. It was filmed in the San Francisco neighborhoods of Tenderloin, North Beach, and Chinatown. It starts off with the band in a dressing room, getting ready for a show, at which point lead singer Karen O walks through a curtain that takes her to the streets of San Francisco. She is walking down a road and dancing, in typical glam fashion. She wears a PVC outfit throughout, while her bandmates remain as secondary characters throughout the video, seen briefly when Karen O joins them in an alleyway where they are playing the song. Towards the end of the video, the band play up and down the aisles of a local discount store.
In popular culture.
"Zero" was used in the television shows "90210", "Ugly Betty", "Gossip Girl", and "The L.A. Complex". The song was also included in the soundtrack for the 2009 video game "".

<doc id="21599729" url="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=21599729" title="Breed club (dog)">
Breed club (dog)

A dog breed club is an association or club of fanciers of a single, specific breed of dog. 
"Breed clubs" define the breed with which the club is associated in a document called a breed standard, although there may be multiple "breed clubs" for the same breed, each defining the breed in a somewhat different manner. "Breed clubs" are "not" scientific organisations, nor are breed standards meant to be scientific descriptions of a breed. "Any" fancier or group of fanciers may start a "breed club" and write definitions to suit themselves.
Purpose.
Dog breed clubs exist to "support the preservation and protection" of the club's breed. Each club defines for itself what exactly the club will do for the breed, depending on the use of the particular breed that is advocated by the breed club.
Breed clubs write the standard for their breed, and independent breed clubs maintain their breed's stud book (other breed clubs are affiliated with a national kennel club, which maintains the stud books of a great many breeds in a central location.)
Breed clubs provide information to the public about their breed. Club members agree to a code of ethics overseen by the club and a list of breeders is usually available to help people find a reputable breeder. Breed clubs also sponsor dog shows for their breed, hunting trials for their breed, and other events related to their particular breed.
Breed clubs promote the benefits and well-being of their particular breed and often offer events to discuss showing, training, breeding, and hereditary health issues. Clubs might also provide judging seminars to train dog event judges, and show clubs might maintain judging lists. Most breed clubs also schedule dog shows or competitions in various dog sports specifically for the breed, and raise funds for research on breed-specific health issues.
History.
Breed clubs for agricultural stock breeds became popular social clubs in England in the late 18th century and early 19th century. The first breed club for chickens, for example, was formed in 1815 as an elite and expensive activity. By the mid-19th century, dog shows were becoming a pastime in Victorian England, and the bulldog was a popular pet. In order to make the bulldog breed smaller and more gentle, crossbreeding with pugs and other types of dogs was being done, leading to the formation of the first breed club, the Bulldog Club, in 1864, to write a breed standard to prevent what the members felt were undesirable changes to the breed. The club only lasted three years. More breed clubs were formed in England after the founding of the Kennel Club in 1873, starting with a new bulldog breed club in 1875 in London.
Membership.
Membership in a breed club is usually done through an application, in which the prospective member explains his or her interest in the breed, and supplies recommendations from other members. Most individuals join breed clubs in order to participate in the club-sponsored activities. Hobby breeders join breed clubs for access to records and information about the breed, and sign the breed club's code of ethics in order to provide puppy buyers with some assurance of the quality of the puppies from members of the club. However, the breed club has no control over the practices of individuals who are not members of the breed club.
Individuals may belong to breed club for different breeds, although belonging to more than one breed club for the same breed is usually frowned upon since the goals of different breed clubs for the same breed may vary. Most breed clubs prohibit mass sales of puppies to brokers and pet shops, so large commercial puppy producers do not belong to breed clubs, although they may register their puppies with a national kennel club. Purchasers of puppies and dogs should research the background and affiliations of kennels.
Forming a breed club.
In general, when a newly created "rare" breed or newly rediscovered landrace or natural breed becomes popular enough, groups of breeders will join together in a club or association, and write a breed standard for their breed. In the standard the club members will define the breed's eternally observable appearance, often in great detail. The standard may also include the breed's observable temperament, and some history of the breed. If members of the breed wish to join a national kennel club, they will write the standard using the national kennel club's format, and will go through an application process (see the Affiliation or independence? section below.) The breed club will obtain or compile the stud book for their breed, which details the descent of all known members of the breed. In addition, members will usually create a code of ethics that will specify details of breeding requirements for member-breeders (although there is no way to make such an ethical code binding on non-members.) 
With the advent of the internet, a breeder can create a "breed club" by putting up a web page to advertise their kennel and their newly created "rare breed". There are also many internet based "kennel clubs" that will accept such "rare breeds" with little or no proof that they fit any of the definitions of the term breed, or without any proof that the "breed club" exists for anything more than to advertise a kennel.
Local and national clubs.
Some breeds of dogs have only one breed club. If the breed club does not belong to a national kennel club, the breed club will maintain all records for the breed, especially the stud book. A breed's stud book is the record of all registered dogs of the breed, going back to the breed's foundation stock.
For many breeds, there is one national breed club and multiple local breed clubs. The local clubs are members of the national breed club, which in turn may be a member of the national kennel club. Most countries have one national kennel club, which maintains the records of the breeds (stud books) of member clubs in a central location. The national kennel club also trains judges and organizes multiple breed dog shows and other activities.
When a breed club writes or changes the standard for its breed, a club which is a member of a national kennel club will submit the standard to the national kennel club for the breed club's country. When the kennel club accepts the standard it is said to be a standard of that national kennel club, but it is originally written by the breed club.
Types of breed clubs.
Working and hunting breed clubs.
Working and hunting dog breeds have breed clubs that define the appearance of the breed, but emphasize working or hunting ability in the selection of breeding stock (although the dogs must not vary too much in appearance from the breed standard, or they will not be registerable.). The emphasis is placed on hunting ability in the selection of breeding stock. In addition, inbreeding may be regulated. The Jack Russell Terrier Club of America code of ethics specifies that "a terrier will be rejected for registration if the inbreeding coefficient is more than 16 percent" in an effort to lessen hereditary disease in the breed. Independent working and hunting breed clubs sometimes maintain an open stud book.
Pet and show breed clubs.
Dog breeds that are primarily kept as pets may be registered with breed clubs that have competition in dog shows and the breeding of showdogs and pets as their primary purposes. Most of the clubs have a closed stud book. Many dogs that are bred for show and pets are inbred, in order to make them as uniform in appearance as possible. 
Close inbreeding, called linebreeding, has only recently been recognised as problematic; generations of breeder manuals have recommended close inbreeding to produce a dog that is highly standardised in appearance. Today, testing for genetic defects before breeding is required by most breed clubs' code of ethics (but not all dog breeders belong to breed clubs, and breed clubs cannot enforce their code on non members, even when the non-members are raising the breed club's breed of dog.)
The Scottish Terrier Club of America's code of ethics directs breeders to "breed only Scottish Terriers of characteristic type, sound structure and temperament... producing dogs in conformity to the AKC Standard." There is no work or hunting requirement or inbreeding prohibitions in this breed, which is primarily kept as a pet and showdog.
Affiliation or independence?
The emphasis on breeding only for appearance in many pet breeds, combined with competitive pressure to breed show-winning dogs, has led in some breeds to extremes in appearance and a loss of working or hunting instincts. For this reason, many working and hunting dog owners will not join breed clubs associated with national kennel clubs, preferring to maintain their breeds and stud books independently. A disadvantage to this approach is the loss of access to the many events and activities that the national clubs can afford to sponsor. Unless the independent breed club is very large, it can suffer from a lack of funding and lobby support that the national kennel clubs can provide, especially with the issue of breed-specific legislation posing a threat to many breeds. 
Breed club members that oppose kennel club acceptance may find their breed accepted into the national kennel club when a minority of members and other breeders break away and form a separate club, and then apply for kennel club acceptance through the new club. In the United States, the Australian Shepherd Club of America, the Jack Russell Terrier Club of America, and the United States Border Collie Club opposed recognition of their breeds by the national kennel club, the American Kennel Club. However, separate breed clubs were formed by some fanciers and breeders for each of these breeds, and then those new clubs applied for membership with the AKC and were accepted. The original breed clubs have continued to maintain their own stud books despite the existence of the new breed clubs which have joined the national kennel club. This has created two separate stud books for these breeds, and has divided the breeds. The kennel club recognition has been compared to a hostile takeover in a Mergers and Acquisitions deal, as national clubs are eager to register popular new breeds. However, there is no way for a breed club to enforce its regulations and code of ethics on non-members of the club.
Other breed organizations.
Other dog clubs encompass multiple breeds of the same type, such as the Hunting Retriever Club for retrievers. Such a club is not usually referred to as a breed club. Crossbred portemanteu-named designer dogs may have affinity groups and clubs that might be called breed clubs, although the dogs are not actually a breed of dog, but are a crossbreed of two breeds. The UK based, Cockapoo Club of GB, has raised standards of ethical breeding by ensuring that Approved Breeders adhere to a Code of Ethics. In the United States, AMBOR is a very active club which organises activities for mixed-breed dogs only.

Philip Strong

Sir Philip Nigel Warrington Strong KBE CMG CStJ (1899–6 July 1983) served as the fifth Anglican Archbishop of Brisbane from 1962 to 1970, also serving as primate of the Church of England in Australia (now called the Anglican Church of Australia) from 1966.
Strong was born in England and educated at the King's School, Worcester (where he was apparently nicknamed "The Bishop") and at Selwyn College, Cambridge. During World War I he served in France with the Royal Engineers. Ordained in 1923, he initially served as a vicar in impoverished industrial parishes in Leeds and Saint Ignatious Hendon,Sunderland.
Following his move to Australasia, Strong served as Bishop of New Guinea between 1936 and 1962, remaining in that post throughout World War II and gaining much respect for his steadfastness during the Japanese invasion of that area.
Archbishop.
During his time as Archbishop of Brisbane, although a religious conservative, Strong was an advocate of co-operation between different Christian denominations.

Aasen mortar

The Aasen mortar (Mortier Aasen) was a 3.5-inch (88.9-mm) gun-mortar (or "bomb thrower" under classification of the time). The Aasen was invented in France in 1915 by Nils Aasen, an arms designer of Norwegian descent. It was adopted by the Russian Empire in 1915-1916, and was used during the First World War.
The barrel of the mortar was steel. Aasen mortar was a breech loading weapon so a shell was loaded separately and the bolt action discharging a blank rifle round connected to a barrel. This device was a modified form of the obsolete Gras rifle, which was transferred to Russia by France in substantial numbers. The hoisting mechanism was made of two slats, attached to the rear of the barrel, and rod folding rack. The weight of the mortar in firing mode was approximately 1.5 "pood" (54.2 lbs).
